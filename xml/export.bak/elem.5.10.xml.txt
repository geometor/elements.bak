Enunciation:
`Of magnitudes which have a ratio to the same`, `that which has a greater ratio is greater`; `and that to which the same has a greater ratio is less`.

Proof:
For let `A` have to `C` a greater ratio than `B` has to `C`; I say that `A` is greater than `B`.
For, if not, `A` is either equal to `B` or less.
Now `A` is not equal to `B`; for in that case each of the magnitudes `A`, `B` would have had the same ratio to `C`; [elem.5.7] but they have not;
Nor again is `A` less than `B`; for in that case `A` would have had to `C` a less ratio than `B` has to `C`; [elem.5.8] but it has not;
But it was proved not to be equal either;
Again, let `C` have to `B` a greater ratio than `C` has to `A`; I say that `B` is less than `A`.
For, if not, it is either equal or greater.
Now `B` is not equal to `A`; for in that case `C` would have had the same ratio to each of the magnitudes `A`, `B`; [elem.5.7] but it has not;
Nor again is `B` greater than `A`; for in that case `C` would have had to `B` a less ratio than it has to `A`; [elem.5.8] but it has not;
But it was proved that it is not equal either;
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
