Proof:
Let a rational straight line  be set out, and  commensurable in length with it; therefore  is also rational.
Let two numbers ,  be set out such that the whole  has not to either of the numbers ,  the ratio which a square number has to a square number.
Let it be contrived that, as  is to , so is the square on  to the square on ; [elem.10.6.p.1] therefore the square on  is commensurable with the square on . [elem.10.6]
But the square on  is rational; therefore the square on  is also rational; therefore  is rational.
Now, since  has not to  the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore neither has the square on  to the square on  the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore  is incommensurable in length with . [elem.10.9]
And both are rational; therefore ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore  is an apotome. [elem.10.73]
Now let the square on  be that by which the square on  is greater than the square on .
Since then, as  is to , so is the square on  to the square on , therefore also, , as  is to , so is the square on  to the square on . [elem.5.19.p.1]
But  has not to  the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore neither has the square on  to the square on  the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore  is incommensurable in length with . [elem.10.9]
And the square on  is greater than the square on  by the square on ; therefore the square on  is greater than the square on  by the square on a straight line incommensurable with .
And the whole  is commensurable in length with the rational straight line  set out.
Therefore  is a fourth apotome. [elem.10.def.3.4]
Therefore the fourth apotome has been found. Q. E. D.
