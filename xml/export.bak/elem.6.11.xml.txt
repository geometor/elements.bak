Enunciation:
`To two given straight lines to find a third proportional`.

Proof:
Let `BA`, `AC` be the two given straight lines, and let them be placed so as to contain any angle; thus it is required to find a third proportional to `BA`, `AC`.
For let them be produced to the points `D`, `E`, and let `BD` be made equal to `AC`; [elem.1.3] let `BC` be joined, and through `D` let `DE` be drawn parallel to it. [elem.1.31]
Since, then, `BC` has been drawn parallel to `DE`, one of the sides of the triangle `ADE`, proportionally, as `AB` is to `BD`, so is `AC` to `CE`. [elem.6.2]
But `BD` is equal to `AC`; therefore, as `AB` is to `AC`, so is `AC` to `CE`.
Therefore to two given straight lines `AB`, `AC` a third proportional to them, `CE`, has been found. Q. E. F.
