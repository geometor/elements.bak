Proof:
For from the straight line  let there be subtracted the straight line  which is incommensurable in square with  and fulfils the given conditions; [elem.10.34] I say that the remainder  is the irrational straight line aforesaid.
For, since the sum of the squares on ,  is medial, while twice the rectangle ,  is rational, therefore the squares on ,  are incommensurable with twice the rectangle , ; therefore the remainder also, the square on , is incommensurable with twice the rectangle , . [elem.2.7 elem.10.16, X. 16]
And twice the rectangle ,  is rational; therefore the square on  is irrational; therefore  is irrational.
And let it be called . Q. E. D.
