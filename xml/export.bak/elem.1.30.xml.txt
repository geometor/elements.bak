Enunciation:
Straight lines parallel to the same straight line are also parallel to one another.

Proof:
Let each of the straight lines `AB`, `CD` be parallel to `EF`; I say that `AB` is also parallel to `CD`.
For let the straight line `GK` fall upon them;
Then, since the straight line `GK` has fallen on the parallel straight lines `AB`, `EF`,
Again, since the straight line `GK` has fallen on the parallel straight lines `EF`, `CD`,
But the angle `AGK` was also proved equal to the angle `GHF`;  and they are alternate.
Therefore `AB` is parallel to `CD`.
