Proof:
Let there be as many numbers as we please, , , , in continued proportion, so that, as  is to , so is  to ; let , ,  by multiplying themselves make , , , and by multiplying , ,  let them make , , ; I say that , ,  and , ,  are in continued proportion.
For let  by multiplying  make , and let the numbers ,  by multiplying  make .  respectively.
And again let  by multiplying  make , and let the numbers ,  by multiplying  make ,  respectively.
Then, in manner similar to the foregoing, we can prove that , ,  and , , ,  are continuously proportional in the ratio of  to , and further , ,  and , , ,  are continuously proportional in the ratio of  to .
Now, as  is to , so is  to ; therefore , ,  are also in the same ratio with , , , and further , , ,  in the same ratio with , , , .
And the multitude of , ,  is equal to the multitude of , , , and that of , , ,  to that of , , , ; therefore, ,  and, as  is to , so is  to . [elem.7.14] Q. E. D.
