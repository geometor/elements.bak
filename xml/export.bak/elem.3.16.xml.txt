Enunciation:
`The straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter of a circle from its extremity will fall outside the circle`, `and into the space between the straight line and the circumference another straight line cannot be interposed; further the angle of the semicircle is greater`, `and the remaining angle less`, `than any acute rectilineal angle`.

Proof:
Let `ABC` be a circle about `D` as centre and `AB` as diameter; I say that the straight line drawn from `A` at right angles to `AB` from its extremity will fall outside the circle.
For suppose it does not, but, if possible, let it fall within as `CA`, and let `DC` be joined.
Since `DA` is equal to `DC`,
But the angle `DAC` is right;  thus, in the triangle `ACD`, the two angles `DAC`, `ACD` are equal to two right angles: which is impossible. [elem.1.17]
Therefore the straight line drawn from the point `A` at right angles to `BA` will not fall within the circle.
Similarly we can prove that neither will it fall on the circumference;
Let it fall as `AE`; I say next that into the space between the straight line `AE` and the circumference `CHA` another straight line cannot be interposed.
For, if possible, let another straight line be so interposed, as `FA`, and let `DG` be drawn from the point `D` perpendicular to `FA`.
Then, since the angle `AGD` is right,
But `DA` is equal to `DH`;
Therefore another straight line cannot be interposed into the space between the straight line and the circumference.
I say further that the angle of the semicircle contained by the straight line `BA` and the circumference `CHA` is greater than any acute rectilineal angle, and the remaining angle contained by the circumference `CHA` and the straight line `AE` is less than any acute rectilineal angle.
For, if there is any rectilineal angle greater than the angle contained by the straight line `BA` and the circumference `CHA`, and any rectilineal angle less than the angle contained by the circumference `CHA` and the straight line `AE`, then into the space between the circumference and the straight line `AE` a straight line will be interposed such as will make an angle contained by straight lines which is greater than the angle contained by the straight line `BA` and the circumference `CHA`, and another angle contained by straight lines which is less than the angle contained by the circumference `CHA` and the straight line `AE`.
But such a straight line cannot be interposed;
therefore there will not be any acute angle contained by straight lines which is greater than the angle contained by the straight line `BA` and the circumference `CHA`, nor yet any acute angle contained by straight lines which is less than the angle contained by the circumference `CHA` and the straight line `AE`.â€”
