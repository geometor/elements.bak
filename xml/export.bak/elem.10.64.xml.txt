Proof:
Let  be the side of a rational plus a medial area, divided into its straight lines at , so that  is the greater; let a rational straight line  be set out, and let there be applied to  the parallelogram  equal to the square on , producing  as its breadth; I say that  is a fifth binomial straight line.
Let the same construction as before be made.
Since then  is the side of a rational plus a medial area, divided at , therefore ,  are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them medial, but the rectangle contained by them rational. [elem.10.40]
Since then the sum of the squares on ,  is medial, therefore  is medial, so that  is rational and incommensurable in length with . [elem.10.22]
Again, since twice the rectangle , , that is , is rational, therefore  is rational and commensurable with . [elem.10.20]
Therefore  is incommensurable with ; [elem.10.13] therefore ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore  is binomial. [elem.10.36]
I say next that it is also a fifth binomial straight line.
For it can be proved similarly that the rectangle ,  is equal to the square on , and that  is incommensurable in length with ; therefore the square on  is greater than the square on  by the square on a straight line incommensurable with . [elem.10.18]
And ,  are commensurable in square only, and the less, , is commensurable in length with .
Therefore  is a fifth binomial. Q. E. D.
