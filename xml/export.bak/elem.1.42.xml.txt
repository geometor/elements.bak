To construct, in a given rectilineal angle, a parallelogram equal to a given triangle.

Proof:
Let `ABC` be the given triangle, and `D` the given rectilineal angle; thus it is required to construct in the rectilineal angle `D` a parallelogram equal to the triangle `ABC`.
Let `BC` be bisected at `E`, and let `AE` be joined; on the straight line `EC`, and at the point `E` on it, let the angle `CEF` be constructed equal to the angle `D`; [elem.1.23] through `A` let `AG` be drawn parallel to `EC`, and [elem.1.31] through `C` let `CG` be drawn parallel to `EF`.
Then `FECG` is a parallelogram.
And, since `BE` is equal to `EC`,
But the parallelogram `FECG` is also double of the triangle `AEC`, for it has the same base with it and is in the same parallels with it; [elem.1.41]
And it has the angle `CEF` equal to the given angle `D`.
Therefore the parallelogram `FECG` has been constructed equal to the given triangle `ABC`, in the angle `CEF` which is equal to `D`. Q. E. F.
