Enunciation:
`If four magnitudes be proportional`, `the greatest and the least are greater than the remaining two`.

Proof:
Let the four magnitudes `AB`, `CD`, `E`, `F` be proportional so that, as `AB` is to `CD`, so is `E` to `F`, and let `AB` be the greatest of them and `F` the least; I say that `AB`, `F` are greater than `CD`, `E`.
For let `AG` be made equal to `E`, and `CH` equal to `F`.
Since, as `AB` is to `CD`, so is `E` to `F`, and `E` is equal to `AG`, and `F` to `CH`,
And since, as the whole `AB` is to the whole `CD`, so is the part `AG` subtracted to the part `CH` subtracted,
But `AB` is greater than `CD`;
And, since `AG` is equal to `E`, and `CH` to `F`, therefore `AG`, `F` are equal to `CH`, `E`.
And if, `GB`, `HD` being unequal, and `GB` greater, `AG`, `F` be added to `GB` and `CH`, `E` be added to `HD`,
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
