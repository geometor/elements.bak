Let  be an apotome of a medial straight line, and let  be commensurable in length with ; I say that  is also an apotome of a medial straight line and the same in order with .
For, since  is an apotome of a medial straight line, let  be the annex to it.
Therefore ,  are medial straight lines commensurable in square only. [elem.10.74 elem.10.75]
Let it be contrived that, as  is to , so is  to ; [elem.6.12] therefore  is also commensurable with , and  with . [elem.5.12, elem.10.11]
But ,  are medial straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore ,  are also medial straight lines [elem.10.23] commensurable in square only; [elem.10.13] therefore  is an apotome of a medial straight line. [elem.10.74 elem.10.75]
I say next that it is also the same in order with .
Since, as  is to , so is  to , therefore also, as the square on  is to the rectangle , , so is the square on  to the rectangle , .
But the square on  is commensurable with the square on ; therefore the rectangle ,  is also commensurable with the rectangle , . [elem.5.16, elem.10.11]
Therefore, if the rectangle ,  is rational, the rectangle ,  will also be rational, [elem.10.def.4] and if the rectangle ,  is medial, the rectangle ,  is also medial. [elem.10.23.p.1]
Therefore  is an apotome of a medial straight line and the same in order with . [elem.10.74 elem.10.75] Q. E. D.
