Enunciation:
`If a straight line be cut into equal and unequal segments, the rectangle contained by the unequal segments of the whole together with the square on the straight line between the points of section is equal to the square on the half`.

Proof:
For let a straight line `AB` be cut into equal segments at `C` and into unequal segments at `D`; I say that the rectangle contained by `AD`, `DB` together with the square on `CD` is equal to the square on `CB`.
For let the square `CEFB` be described on `CB`, [elem.1.46] and let `BE` be joined; through `D` let `DG` be drawn parallel to either `CE` or `BF`, through `H` again let `KM` be drawn parallel to either `AB` or `EF`, and again through `A` let `AK` be drawn parallel to either `CL` or `BM`. [elem.1.31]
Then, since the complement `CH` is equal to the complement `HF`, [elem.1.43] let `DM` be added to each;
But `CM` is equal to `AL`,  Let `CH` be added to each;
But `AH` is the rectangle `AD`, `DB`, for `DH` is equal to `DB`,
Let `LG`, which is equal to the square on `CD`, be added to each;
But the gnomon `NOP` and `LG` are the whole square `CEFB`, which is described on `CB`;
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
