Proof:
Let  be a medial straight line; I say that from  there arise irrational straight lines infinite in number, and none of them is the same as any of the preceding.
Let a rational straight line  be set out,  and let the square on  be equal to the rectangle , ; therefore  is irrational; [elem.10.def.4] for that which is contained by an irrational and a rational straight line is irrational. [deduction from elem.10.20]
And it is not the same with any of the preceding; for the square on none of the preceding, if applied to a rational straight line produces as breadth a medial straight line.
Again, let the square on  be equal to the rectangle , ; therefore the square on  is irrational. [deduction from elem.10.20]
Therefore  is irrational; [elem.10.def.4] and it is not the same with any of the preceding, for the square on none of the preceding, if applied to a rational straight line, produces  as breadth.
Similarly, if this arrangement proceeds , it is manifest that from the medial straight line there arise irrational straight lines infinite in number, and none is the same with any of the preceding. Q. E. D.
