Proof:
Let the rational straight lines , ,  commensurable in square only be set out; let  be taken a mean proportional between , , [elem.6.13] and let it be contrived that,
Since ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, therefore the rectangle , , that is, the square on  [elem.6.17], is medial. [elem.10.21]
Therefore  is medial. [elem.10.21]
And since ,  are commensurable in square only, and, as  is to , so is  to , therefore ,  are also commensurable in square only. [elem.10.11]
But  is medial; therefore  is also medial. [elem.10.23, addition]
Therefore ,  are medial straight lines commensurable in square only.
I say next that they also contain a medial rectangle.
For since, as  is to , so is  to , therefore, alternately, as  is to , so is  to . [elem.5.16]
But, as  is to , so is  to ; therefore also, as  is to , so is  to ; therefore the rectangle ,  is equal to the rectangle , . [elem.6.16]
But the rectangle ,  is medial; [elem.10.21] therefore the rectangle ,  is also medial.
Therefore medial straight lines commensurable in square only have been found which contain a medial rectangle. Q. E. D.
