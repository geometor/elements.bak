Proof:
For let a straight line  be set up at right angles to the three straight lines , , , at their point of meeting at ; I say that , ,  are in one plane.
For suppose they are not, but, if possible, let ,  be in the plane of reference and  in one more elevated; let the plane through ,  be produced; it will thus make, as common section in the plane of reference, a straight line. [elem.11.3]
Let it make .
Therefore the three straight lines , ,  are in one plane, namely that drawn through , .
Now, since  is at right angles to each of the straight lines , , therefore  is also at right angles to the plane through , . [elem.11.4]
But the plane through ,  is the plane of reference; therefore  is at right angles to the plane of reference.
Thus  will also make right angles with all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane of reference. [elem.11.def.3]
But  which is in the plane of reference meets it; therefore the angle  is right.
But, by hypothesis, the angle  is also right; therefore the angle  is equal to the angle .
And they are in one plane: which is impossible.
Therefore the straight line  is not in a more elevated plane; therefore the three straight lines , ,  are in one plane.
Therefore, if a straight line be set up at right angles to three straight lines, at their point of meeting, the three straight lines are in one plane. Q. E. D.
