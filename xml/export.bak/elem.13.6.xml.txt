Proof:
Let  be a rational straight line, let it be cut in extreme and mean ratio at , and let  be the greater segment; I say that each of the straight lines ,  is the irrational straight line called apotome.
For let  be produced, and let  be made half of .
Since then the straight line  has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, and to the greater segment  is added  which is half of , therefore the square on  is five times the square on . [elem.13.1]
Therefore the square on  has to the square on  the ratio which a number has to a number; therefore the square on  is commensurable with the square on . [elem.10.6]
But the square on  is rational, for  is rational, being half of  which is rational; therefore the square on  is also rational; [elem.10.def.4] therefore  is also rational.
And, since the square on  has not to the square on  the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore  is incommensurable in length with ; [elem.10.9] therefore ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore  is an apotome. [elem.10.73]
Again, since  has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, and  is the greater segment, therefore the rectangle ,  is equal to the square on . [elem.6.def.3, elem.6.17]
Therefore the square on the apotome , if applied to the rational straight line , produces  as breadth.
But the square on an apotome, if applied to a rational straight line, produces as breadth a first apotome; [elem.10.97] therefore  is a first apotome.
And  was also proved to be an apotome.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
