Proof:
Let ,  be circles, let ,  be similar polygons inscribed in them, and let ,  be diameters of the circles; I say that, as the square on  is to the square on , so is the polygon  to the polygon .
For let , , ,  be joined.
Now, since the polygon  is similar to the polygon , the angle  is equal to the angle , and, as  is to , so is  to . [VI. Def. I]
Thus ,  are two triangles which have one angle equal to one angle, namely the angle  to the angle , and the sides about the equal angles proportional; therefore the triangle  is equiangular with the triangle . [elem.6.6]
Therefore the angle  is equal to the angle .
But the angle  is equal to the angle , for they stand on the same circumference; [elem.3.27] and the angle  to the angle ; therefore the angle  is also equal to the angle .
But the right angle  is also equal to the right angle ; [elem.3.31] therefore the remaining angle is equal to the remaining angle. [elem.1.32]
Therefore the triangle  is equiangular with the triangle .
Therefore, proportionally, as  is to , so is  to . [elem.6.4]
But the ratio of the square on  to the square on  is duplicate of the ratio of  to , and the ratio of the polygon  to the polygon  is duplicate of the ratio of  to ; [elem.6.20] therefore also, as the square on  is to the square on , so is the polygon  to the polygon .
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
