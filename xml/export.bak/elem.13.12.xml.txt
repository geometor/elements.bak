Proof:
Let  be a circle, and let the equilateral triangle  be inscribed in it; I say that the square on one side of the triangle  is triple of the square on the radius of the circle.
For let the centre  of the circle  be taken, let  be joined and carried through to , and let  be joined.
Then, since the triangle  is equilateral, therefore the circumference  is a third part of the circumference of the circle .
Therefore the circumference  is a sixth part of the circumference of the circle; therefore the straight line  belongs to a hexagon; therefore it is equal to the radius . [elem.4.15.p.1]
And, since  is double of , the square on  is quadruple of the square on , that is, of the square on .
But the square on  is equal to the squares on , ; [elem.3.31, elem.1.47] therefore the squares on ,  are quadruple of the square on .
Therefore, , the square on  is triple of the square on .
But  is equal to ; therefore the square on  is triple of the square on .
Therefore the square on the side of the triangle is triple of the square on the radius. Q. E. D.
