To construct, in a given rectilineal angle, a parallelogram equal to a given rectilineal figure.

Proof:
Let `ABCD` be the given rectilineal figure and `E` the given rectilineal angle; thus it is required to construct, in the given angle `E`, a parallelogram equal to the rectilineal figure `ABCD`.
Let `DB` be joined, and let the parallelogram `FH` be constructed equal to the triangle `ABD`, in the angle `HKF` which is equal to `E`; [elem.1.42] let the parallelogram `GM` equal to the triangle `DBC` be applied to the straight line `GH`, in the angle `GHM` which is equal to `E`. [elem.1.44]
Then, since the angle `E` is equal to each of the angles `HKF`, `GHM`,
Let the angle `KHG` be added to each; therefore the angles `FKH`, `KHG` are equal to the angles `KHG`, `GHM`.
But the angles `FKH`, `KHG` are equal to two right angles; [elem.1.29] therefore the angles `KHG`, `GHM` are also equal to two right angles.
Thus, with a straight line `GH`, and at the point `H` on it, two straight lines `KH`, `HM` not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles equal to two right angles;
And, since the straight line `HG` falls upon the parallels `KM`, `FG`, the alternate angles `MHG`, `HGF` are equal to one another. [elem.1.29]
Let the angle `HGL` be added to each; therefore the angles `MHG`, `HGL` are equal to the angles `HGF`, `HGL`. [elem.1.c.n.2]
But the angles `MHG`, `HGL` are equal to two right angles; [elem.1.29] therefore the angles `HGF`, `HGL` are also equal to two right angles. [elem.1.c.n.1]
And, since `FK` is equal and parallel to `HG`, [elem.1.34] 
        `KF` is also equal and parallel to `ML`; [elem.1.c.n.1;elem.1.30] and the straight lines `KM`, `FL` join them (at their extremities); therefore `KM`, `FL` are also equal and parallel. [elem.1.33]
And, since the triangle `ABD` is equal to the parallelogram `FH`, 
        the whole rectilineal figure `ABCD` is equal to the whole parallelogram `KFLM`.
Therefore the parallelogram `KFLM` has been constructed equal to the given rectilineal figure `ABCD`, in the angle `FKM` which is equal to the given angle `E`.
