Proof:
Let  be a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole, and  commensurable with ; I say that  is also a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole.
For let  be the annex to ; therefore ,  are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on ,  medial, but the rectangle contained by them rational. [elem.10.77]
Let the same construction be made.
Then we can prove, in manner similar to the foregoing, that ,  are in the same ratio as , , the sum of the squares on ,  is commensurable with the sum of the squares on , , and the rectangle ,  with the rectangle , ; so that ,  are also straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on ,  medial, but the rectangle contained by them rational.
Therefore  is a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole. [elem.10.77] Q. E. D.
