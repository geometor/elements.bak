Proof:
For let the square on the straight line  be five times the square on the segment  of it, and let  be double of ; I say that, when  is cut in extreme and mean ratio, the greater segment is .
Let the squares ,  be described on ,  respectively, let the figure in  be drawn, and let  be drawn through.
Now, since the square on  is five times the square on ,  is five times .
Therefore the gnomon  is quadruple of .
And, since  is double of , therefore the square on  is quadruple of the square on , that is,  is quadruple of .
But the gnomon  was also proved quadruple of ; therefore the gnomon  is equal to .
And, since  is double of , while  is equal to , and  to , therefore  is also double of . [elem.6.1]
But ,  are also double of ; therefore  is equal to , .
But the whole gnomon  was also proved equal to the whole ; therefore the remainder  is equal to .
And  is the rectangle , , for  is equal to ; and  is the square on ; therefore the rectangle ,  is equal to the square on .
Therefore, as  is to , so is  to .
But  is greater than ; therefore  is also greater than .
Therefore, when the straight line  is cut in extreme and mean ratio,  is the greater segment.
