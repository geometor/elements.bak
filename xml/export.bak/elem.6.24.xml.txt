`In any parallelogram the parallelograms about the diameter are similar both to the whole and to one another`.

Proof:
Let `ABCD` be a parallelogram, and `AC` its diameter, and let `EG`, `HK` be parallelograms about `AC`; I say that each of the parallelograms `EG`, `HK` is similar both to the whole `ABCD` and to the other.
For, since `EF` has been drawn parallel to `BC`, one of the sides of the triangle `ABC`,
Again, since `FG` has been drawn parallel to `CD`, one of the sides of the triangle `ACD`,
But it was proved that,  and therefore, `componendo`,  and, alternately,
Therefore in the parallelograms `ABCD`, `EG`, the sides about the common angle `BAD` are proportional.
And, since `GF` is parallel to `DC`,  and the angle `DAC` is common to the two triangles `ADC`, `AGF`;
For the same reason  and the whole parallelogram `ABCD` is equiangular with the parallelogram `EG`.
Therefore, proportionally,  and further, as `CB` is to `BA`, so is `FE` to `EA`.
And, since it was proved that,  and, as `AC` is to `CB`, so is `AF` to `FE`, therefore, , as `DC` is to `CB`, so is `GF` to `FE`. [elem.5.22]
Therefore in the parallelograms `ABCD`, `EG` the sides about the equal angles are proportional; therefore the parallelogram `ABCD` is similar to the parallelogram `EG`. [elem.6.def.1]
For the same reason the parallelogram `ABCD` is also similar to the parallelogram `KH`; therefore each of the parallelograms `EG`, `HK` is similar to `ABCD`.
But figures similar to the same rectilineal figure are also similar to one another; [elem.6.21] therefore the parallelogram `EG` is also similar to the parallelogram `HK`.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
