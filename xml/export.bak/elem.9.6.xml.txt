Proof:
For let the number  by multiplying itself make the cube number ; I say that  is also cube.
For let  by multiplying  make .
Since, then,  by multiplying itself has made , and by multiplying  has made , therefore  is cube.
And, since  by multiplying itself has made , therefore  measures  according to the units in itself.
But the unit also measures  according to the units in it.
Therefore, as the unit is to , so is  to . [elem.7.def.20]
And, since  by multiplying  has made , therefore  measures  according to the units in .
But the unit also measures  according to the units in it.
Therefore, as the unit is to , so is  to . [elem.7.def.20]
But, as the unit is to , so is  to ; therefore also, as  is to , so is  to .
And, since ,  are cube, they are similar solid numbers.
Therefore there are two mean proportional numbers between , . [elem.8.19]
And, as  is to , so is  to .
Therefore there are two mean proportional numbers between ,  also. [elem.8.8]
And  is cube; therefore  is also cube. [cf. elem.8.23] Q. E. D.
