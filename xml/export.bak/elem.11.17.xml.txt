Proof:
For let the two straight lines ,  be cut by the parallel planes , ,  at the points , ,  and , , ; I say that, as the straight line  is to , so is  to .
For let , ,  be joined, let  meet the plane  at the point , and let ,  be joined.
Now, since the two parallel planes ,  are cut by the plane , their common sections ,  are parallel. [elem.11.16]
For the same reason, since the two parallel planes ,  are cut by the plane , their common sections ,  are parallel. [.]
And, since the straight line  has been drawn parallel to , one of the sides of the triangle , therefore, proportionally, as  is to , so is  to . [elem.6.2]
Again, since the straight line  has been drawn parallel to , one of the sides of the triangle , proportionally, as  is to , so is  to . [.]
But it was also proved that, as  is to , so is  to ; therefore also, as  is to , so is  to . [elem.5.11]
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
