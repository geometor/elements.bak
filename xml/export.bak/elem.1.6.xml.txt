Enunciation:
If in a triangle two angles be equal to one another, the sides which subtend the equal angles will also be equal to one another.

Proof:
Let `ABC` be a triangle having the angle `ABC` equal to the angle `ACB`;
I say that the side `AB` is also equal to the side `AC`.
For, if `AB` is unequal to `AC`, one of them is greater.
Let `AB` be greater; and from `AB` the greater let `DB` be cut off equal to `AC` the less;
let `DC` be joined.
Then, since `DB` is equal to `AC`, and `BC` is common, 
        and the angle `DBC` is equal to the angle `ACB`;
Therefore etc.
