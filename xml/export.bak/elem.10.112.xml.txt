Proof:
Let  be a rational straight line, let  be a binomial, and let  be its greater term; let the rectangle ,  be equal to the square on ;  I say that  is an apotome the terms of which are commensurable with , , and in the same ratio, and further  will have the same order as .
For again let the rectangle ,  be equal to the square on .
Since then the rectangle ,  is equal to the rectangle , , therefore, as  is to , so is  to . [elem.6.16]
But  is greater than ; therefore  is also greater than . [elem.5.16, elem.5.14]
Let  be equal to ; therefore, as  is to , so is  to ; therefore, , as  is to , so is  to . [elem.5.17]
Let it be contrived that, as  is to , so is  to ; therefore also the whole  is to the whole  as  is to ; for, as one of the antecedents is to one of the consequents, so are all the antecedents to all the consequents. [elem.5.12]
But, as  is to , so is  to ; [elem.5.11] therefore also, as  is to , so is  to . [id.]
But the square on  is commensurable with the square on ; [elem.10.36] therefore the square on  is also commensurable with the square on . [elem.6.22, elem.10.11]
And, as the square on  is to the square on , so is  to , since the three straight lines , ,  are proportional. [elem.5.def.9]
Therefore  is commensurable in length with , so that  is also commensurable in length with . [elem.10.15]
Now, since the square on  is equal to the rectangle , , while the square on  is rational, therefore the rectangle ,  is also rational.
And it is applied to the rational straight line ; therefore  is rational and commensurable in length with ; [elem.10.20] so that , being commensurable with it, is also rational and commensurable in length with .
Since, then, as  is to , so is  to , while ,  are straight lines commensurable in square only, therefore ,  are also commensurable in square only. [elem.10.11]
But  is rational; therefore  is also rational.
Therefore ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore  is an apotome. [elem.10.73]
Now the square on  is greater than the square on  either by the square on a straight line commensurable with  or by the square on a straight line incommensurable with it.
If then the square on  is greater than the square on  by the square on a straight line commensurable with , the square on  is also greater than the square on  by the square on a straight line commensurable with . [elem.10.14]
And, if  is commensurable in length with the rational straight line set out, so also is ; [elem.10.11 elem.10.12] if  is so commensurable, so also is ; [elem.10.12] but, if neither of the straight lines ,  is so commensurable, neither of the straight lines ,  is so.
But, if the square on  is greater than the square on  by the square on a straight line incommensurable with , the square on  is also greater than the square on  by the square on a straight line incommensurable with . [elem.10.14]
And, if  is commensurable with the rational straight line set out, so also is ; if  is so commensurable, so also is ; but, if neither of the straight lines ,  is so commensurable, neither of the straight lines ,  is so; so that  is an apotome, the terms of which ,  are commensurable with the terms ,  of the binomial straight line and in the same ratio, and it has the same order as .
