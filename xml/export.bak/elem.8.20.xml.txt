Proof:
For let one mean proportional number  fall between the two numbers , ; I say that ,  are similar plane numbers.
Let , , the least numbers of those which have the same ratio with , , be taken; [elem.7.33] therefore  measures  the same number of times that  measures . [elem.7.20]
Now, as many times as  measures , so many units let there be in ; therefore  by multiplying  has made , so that  is plane, and ,  are its sides.
Again, since ,  are the least of the numbers which have the same ratio with , , therefore  measures  the same number of times that  measures . [elem.7.20]
As many times, then, as  measures , so many units let there be in ; therefore  measures  according to the units in ; therefore  by multiplying  has made .
Therefore  is plane, and ,  are its sides.
Therefore ,  are plane numbers.
I say next that they are also similar.
For, <*> since  by multiplying  has made , and by multiplying  has made , therefore, as  is to , so is  to , that is,  to . [elem.7.17]
Again, <*> since  by multiplying ,  has made ,  respectively, therefore, as  is to , so is  to . [elem.7.17]
But, as  is to , so is  to ; therefore also, as  is to , so is  to .
And alternately, as  is to , so is  to . [elem.7.13]
Therefore ,  are similar plane numbers; for their sides are proportional. Q. E. D.
