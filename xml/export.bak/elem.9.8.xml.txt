Proof:
Let there be as many numbers as we please, , , , , , , beginning from an unit and in continued proportion; I say that , the third from the unit, is square, as are also all those which leave out one; , the fourth, is cube, as are also all those which leave out two; and , the seventh, is at once cube and square, as are also all those which leave out five.
For since, as the unit is to , so is  to , therefore the unit measures the number  the same number of times that  measures . [elem.7.def.20]
But the unit measures the number  according to the units in it; therefore  also measures  according to the units in .
Therefore  by multiplying itself has made ; therefore  is square.
And, since , ,  are in continued proportion, and  is square, therefore  is also square. [elem.8.22]
For the same reason  is also square.
Similarly we can prove that all those which leave out one are square.
I say next that , the fourth from the unit, is cube, as are also all those which leave out two.
For since, as the unit is to , so is  to , therefore the unit measures the number  the same number of times that  measures .
But the unit measures the number  according to the units in ; therefore  also measures  according to the units in .
Therefore  by multiplying  has made .
Since then  by multiplying itself has made , and by multiplying  has made , therefore  is cube.
And, since , , ,  are in continued proportion, and  is cube, therefore  is also cube. [elem.8.23]
But it was also proved square; therefore the seventh from the unit is both cube and square.
Similarly we can prove that all the numbers which leave out five are also both cube and square. Q. E. D.
