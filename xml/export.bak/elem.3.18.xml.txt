Enunciation:
`If a straight line touch a circle`, `and a straight line be joined from the centre to the point of contact`, `the straight line so joined will be perpendicular to the tangent`.

Proof:
For let a straight line `DE` touch the circle `ABC` at the point `C`, let the centre `F` of the circle `ABC` be taken, and let `FC` be joined from `F` to `C`; I say that `FC` is perpendicular to `DE`.
For, if not, let `FG` be drawn from `F` perpendicular to `DE`.
Then, since the angle `FGC` is right,  and the greater angle is subtended by the greater side; [elem.1.19]
But `FC` is equal to `FB`;
Therefore `FG` is not perpendicular to `DE`.
Similarly we can prove that neither is any other straight line except `FC`;
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
