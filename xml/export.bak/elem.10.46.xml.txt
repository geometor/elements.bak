Proof:
Let  be the side of a rational plus a medial area divided at , so that ,  are incommensurable in square and make the sum of the squares on ,  medial, but twice the rectangle ,  rational; [elem.10.40
] I say that  is not so divided at another point.
For, if possible, let it be divided at  also, so that ,  are also incommensurable in square and make the sum of the squares on ,  medial, but twice the rectangle ,  rational.
Since then that by which twice the rectangle ,  differs from twice the rectangle ,  is also that by which the squares on ,  differ from the squares on , , while twice the rectangle ,  exceeds twice the rectangle ,  by a rational area, therefore the squares on ,  also exceed the squares on ,  by a rational area, though they are medial: which is impossible. [elem.10.26
]
Therefore the side of a rational plus a medial area is not divided at different points; therefore it is divided at one point only. Q. E. D.
