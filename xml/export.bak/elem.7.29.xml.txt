Proof:
Let  be a prime number, and let it not measure ; I say that ,  are prime to one another.
For, if ,  are not prime to one another, some number will measure them.
Let  measure them.
Since  measures , and  does not measure , therefore  is not the same with .
Now, since  measures , , therefore it also measures  which is prime, though it is not the same with it: which is impossible.
Therefore no number will measure , .
Therefore ,  are prime to one another. Q. E. D.
