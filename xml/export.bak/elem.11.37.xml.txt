Proof:
Let , , ,  be four straight lines in proportion, so that, as  is to , so is  to ; and let there be described on , , ,  the similar and similarly situated parallelepipedal solids , , , ; I say that, as  is to , so is  to .
For, since the parallelepipedal solid  is similar to , therefore  has to  the ratio triplicate of that which  has to . [elem.11.33]
For the same reason  also has to  the ratio triplicate of that which  has to . [.]
And, as  is to , so is  to .
Therefore also, as  is to , so is  to .
Next, as the solid  is to the solid , so let the solid  be to the solid ; I say that, as the straight line  is to , so is  to .
For since, again,  has to  the ratio triplicate of that which  has to , [elem.11.33] and  also has to  the ratio triplicate of that which  has to , [.] and, as  is to , so is  to , therefore also, as  is to , so is  to .
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
