Enunciation:
If two straight lines cut one another, they make the vertical angles equal to one another.

Proof:
For let the straight lines `AB`, `CD` cut one another at the point `E`;
I say that the angle `AEC` is equal to the angle `DEB`,
For, since the straight line `AE` stands on the straight line `CD`, making the angles `CEA`, `AED`,
Again, since the straight line `DE` stands on the straight line `AB`, making the angles `AED`, `DEB`,
But the angles `CEA`, `AED` were also proved equal to two right angles;
Similarly it can be proved that the angles `CEB`, `DEA` are also equal.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
