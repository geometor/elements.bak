`About a given pentagon`, `which is equilateral and equiangular`, `to circumscribe a circle`.

Proof:
Let `ABCDE` be the given pentagon, which is equilateral and equiangular; thus it is required to circumscribe a circle about the pentagon `ABCDE`.
Let the angles `BCD`, `CDE` be bisected by the straight lines `CF`, `DF` respectively, and from the point `F`, at which the straight lines meet, let the straight lines `FB`, `FA`, `FE` be joined to the points `B`, `A`, `E`.
Then in manner similar to the preceding it can be proved that the angles `CBA`, `BAE`, `AED` have also been bisected by the straight lines `FB`, `FA`, `FE` respectively.
Now, since the angle `BCD` is equal to the angle `CDE`, and the angle `FCD` is half of the angle `BCD`, and the angle `CDF` half of the angle `CDE`, therefore the angle `FCD` is also equal to the angle `CDF`,
Similarly it can be proved that each of the straight lines `FB`, `FA`, `FE` is also equal to each of the straight lines `FC`, `FD`; therefore the five straight lines `FA`, `FB`, `FC`, `FD`, `FE` are equal to one another.
Therefore the circle described with centre `F` and distance one of the straight lines `FA`, `FB`, `FC`, `FD`, `FE` will pass also through the remaining points, and will have been circumscribed.
Let it be circumscribed, and let it be `ABCDE`.
Therefore about the given pentagon, which is equilateral and equiangular, a circle has been circumscribed. Q. E. F.
