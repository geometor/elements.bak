Proof:
For in the equilateral and equiangular pentagon  let the straight lines , , cutting one another at the point , subtend two angles taken in order, the angles at , ; I say that each of them has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at the point , and their greater segments are equal to the side of the pentagon.
For let the circle  be circumscribed about the pentagon . [elem.4.14]
Then, since the two straight lines ,  are equal to the two , , and they contain equal angles, therefore the base  is equal to the base , the triangle  is equal to the triangle , and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles respectively, namely those which the equal sides subtend. [elem.1.4]
Therefore the angle  is equal to the angle ; therefore the angle  is double of the angle . [elem.1.32]
But the angle  is also double of the angle , inasmuch as the circumference  is also double of the circumference ; [elem.3.28, elem.6.33] therefore the angle  is equal to the angle ; hence the straight line  is also equal to , that is, to . [elem.1.6]
And, since the straight line  is equal to , the angle  is also equal to the angle . [elem.1.5]
But the angle  was proved equal to the angle ; therefore the angle  is also equal to the angle .
And the angle  is common to the two triangles  and ; therefore the remaining angle  is equal to the remaining angle ; [elem.1.32] therefore the triangle  is equiangular with the triangle ; therefore, proportionally, as  is to , so is  to . [elem.6.4]
But  is equal to ; therefore, as  is to , so is  to .
And  is greater than ; therefore  is also greater than . [elem.5.14]
Therefore  has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at , and the greater segment  is equal to the side of the pentagon.
Similarly we can prove that  has also been cut in extreme and mean ratio at , and its greater segment  is equal to the side of the pentagon. Q. E. D.
