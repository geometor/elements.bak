Proof:
For let the solid  be contained by the parallel planes , , , , , ; I say that the opposite planes in it are equal and parallelogrammic.
For, since the two parallel planes ,  are cut by the plane , their common sections are parallel. [elem.11.16]
Therefore  is parallel to .
Again, since the two parallel planes ,  are cut by the plane , their common sections are parallel. [elem.11.16]
Therefore  is parallel to .
But  was also proved parallel to ; therefore  is a parallelogram.
Similarly we can prove that each of the planes , , , ,  is a parallelogram.
Let ,  be joined.
Then, since  is parallel to , and  to , the two straight lines ,  which meet one another are parallel to the two straight lines ,  which meet one another, not in the same plane; therefore they will contain equal angles; [elem.11.10] therefore the angle  is equal to the angle .
And, since the two sides ,  are equal to the two sides , , [elem.1.34] and the angle  is equal to the angle , therefore the base  is equal to the base , and the triangle  is equal to the triangle . [elem.1.4]
And the parallelogram  is double of the triangle , and the parallelogram  double of the triangle ; [elem.1.34] therefore the parallelogram  is equal to the parallelogram .
Similarly we can prove that  is also equal to , and  to .
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
