Proof:
Let a rational straight line  be set out, and let  be commensurable in length with ; therefore  is rational.
Let two numbers ,  be set out such that  again has not to either of the numbers ,  the ratio which a square number has to a square number; and let it be contrived that, as  is to , so is the square on  to the square on .
Therefore the square on  is also rational; [elem.10.6] therefore  is also rational.
Now since, as  is to , so is the square on  to the square on , while  has not to  the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore neither has the square on  to the square on  the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore  is incommensurable in length with . [elem.10.9]
And both are rational; therefore ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore  is an apotome. [elem.10.73]
I say next that it is also a fifth apotome.
For let the square on  be that by which the square on  is greater than the square on .
Since then, as the square on  is to the square on , so is  to , therefore, , as  is to , so is the square on  to the square on . [elem.5.19.p.1]
But  has not to  the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore neither has the square on  to the square on  the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore  is incommensurable in length with . [elem.10.9]
And the square on  is greater than the square on  by the square on ; therefore the square on  is greater than the square on  by the square on a straight line incommensurable in length with .
And the annex  is commensurable in length with the rational straight line  set out; therefore  is a fifth apotome. [elem.10.def.3.5]
Therefore the fifth apotome  has been found. Q. E. D.
