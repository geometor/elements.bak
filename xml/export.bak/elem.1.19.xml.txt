Enunciation:
In any triangle the greater angle is subtended by the greater side.

Proof:
Let `ABC` be a triangle having the angle `ABC` greater than the angle `BCA`;
I say that the side `AC` is also greater than the side `AB`.
For, if not, `AC` is either equal to `AB` or less.
Now `AC` is not equal to `AB`; for then the angle `ABC` would also have been equal to the angle `ACB`; [elem.1.5] but it is not;
Neither is `AC` less than `AB`, for then the angle `ABC` would also have been less than the angle `ACB`; [elem.1.18] but it is not;
And it was proved that it is not equal either.
Therefore etc.
