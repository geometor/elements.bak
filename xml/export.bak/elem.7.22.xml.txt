Proof:
Let ,  be the least numbers of those which have the same ratio with them; I say that ,  are prime to one another.
For, if they are not prime to one another, some number will measure them.
Let some number measure them, and let it be .
And, as many times as  measures , so many units let there be in , and, as many times as  measures , so many units let there be in
Since  measures  according to the units in , therefore  by multiplying  has made . [elem.7.def.15]
For the same reason also  by multiplying  has made .
Thus the number  by multiplying the two numbers ,  has made , ; therefore, as  is to , so is  to ; [elem.7.17] therefore ,  are in the same ratio with , , being less than they: which is impossible.
Therefore no number will measure the numbers , .
Therefore ,  are prime to one another. Q. E. D.
