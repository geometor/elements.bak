Proof:
Let ,  be two numbers prime to one another, let  by multiplying itself make , and by multiplying  make , and let  by multiplying itself make , and by multiplying  make ; I say that both ,  and ,  are prime to one another.
For, since ,  are prime to one another, and  by multiplying itself has made , therefore ,  are prime to one another. [elem.7.25]
Since then ,  are prime to one another, and  by multiplying itself has made , therefore ,  are prime to one another. [.]
Again, since ,  are prime to one another, and  by multiplying itself has made , therefore ,  are prime to one another. [.]
Since then the two numbers ,  are prime to the two numbers , , both to each, therefore also the product of ,  is prime to the product of , . [elem.7.26]
And the product of ,  is , and the product of ,  is .
Therefore ,  are prime to one another. Q. E. D.
