Enunciation:
Parallelograms which are on the same base and in the same parallels are equal to one another.

Proof:
Let `ABCD`, `EBCF` be parallelograms on the same base `BC` and in the same parallels `AF`, `BC`; I say that `ABCD` is equal to the parallelogram `EBCF`.
For, since `ABCD` is a parallelogram,
For the same reason also  and `DE` is common;
But `AB` is also equal to `DC`; [elem.1.34] therefore the two sides `EA`, `AB` are equal to the two sides `FD`, `DC` respectively,
Let `DGE` be subtracted from each; therefore the trapezium `ABGD` which remains is equal to the trapezium `EGCF` which remains. [elem.1.c.n.3]
Let the triangle `GBC` be added to each; therefore the whole parallelogram `ABCD` is equal to the whole parallelogram `EBCF`. [elem.1.c.n.2]
Therefore etc.
