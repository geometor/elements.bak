Proof:
For let the area  be contained by the rational straight line  and the sixth binomial , divided into its terms at , so that  is the greater term; I say that the 
 of  is the side of the sum of two medial areas.
Let the same construction be made as before shown.
It is then manifest that  is the 
 of , and that  is incommensurable in square with
Now, since  is incommensurable in length with , therefore ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore , that is, the sum of the squares on , , is medial. [elem.10.21]
Again, since  is incommensurable in length with , therefore  is also incommensurable with ; [elem.10.13] therefore ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore , that is, , that is, the rectangle , , is medial. [elem.10.21]
And, since  is incommensurable with ,  is also incommensurable with  [elem.6.1, elem.10.11]
But  is the sum of the squares on , , and  is the rectangle , ; therefore the sum of the squares on ,  is incommensurable with the rectangle ,
And each of them is medial, and ,  are incommensurable in square.
Therefore  is the side of the sum of two medial areas [elem.10.41], and is the 
 of . Q. E. D.
