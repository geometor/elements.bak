Proof:
Let there be as many numbers as we please in continued proportion, , , , , beginning from  as least, and let there be subtracted from  and  the numbers , , each equal to ; I say that, as  is to , so is  to , , .
For let  be made equal to , and  equal to .
Then, since  is equal to , and of these the part  is equal to the part , therefore the remainder  is equal to the remainder .
And since, as  is to , so is  to , and  to , while  is equal to ,  to , and  to , therefore, as  is to , so is  to , and  to .
, as  is to , so is  to , and  to . [elem.7.11 elem.7.13]
Therefore also, as one of the antecedents is to one of the consequents, so are all the antecedents to all the consequents; [elem.7.12] therefore, as  is to , so are , .  to , , .
But  is equal to ,  to , and , ,  to , , ; therefore, as  is to , so is  to , , .
