Enunciation:
`If there be three magnitudes`, `and others equal to them in multitude`, `which taken two and two are in the same ratio`, `and if`
       
       `the first be greater than the third`, `the fourth will also be greater than the sixth`; `if equal`, `equal`; `and`, `if less`, `less`.

Proof:
Let there be three magnitudes `A`, `B`, `C`, and others `D`, `E`, `F` equal to them in multitude, which taken two and two are in the same ratio, so that,  and as `B` is to `C`, so is `E` to `F`; and let `A` be greater than `C`; I say that `D` will also be greater than `F`; if `A` is equal to `C`, equal; and, if less, less.
For, since `A` is greater than `C`, and `B` is some other magnitude, and the greater has to the same a greater ratio than the less has, [elem.5.8] therefore `A` has to `B` a greater ratio than `C` has to `B`.
But, as `A` is to `B`, so is `D` to `E`, and, as `C` is to `B`, inversely, so is `F` to `E`; therefore `D` has also to `E` a greater ratio than `F` has to `E`. [elem.5.13]
But, of magnitudes which have a ratio to the same, that which has a greater ratio is greater; [elem.5.10]
Similarly we can prove that, if `A` be equal to `C`, `D` will also be equal to `F`; and if less, less.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
