Proof:
For let two straight lines ,  incommensurable in square, and fulfilling the given conditions [elem.10.34
], be added together; I say that  is irrational.
For, since the sum of the squares on ,  is medial, while twice the rectangle ,  is rational, therefore the sum of the squares on ,  is incommensurable with twice the rectangle , ; so that the square on  is also incommensurable with twice the rectangle , . [elem.10.16
]
But twice the rectangle ,  is rational; therefore the square on  is irrational.
Therefore  is irrational. [elem.10.def.4
]
And let it be called the . Q. E. D.
