Enunciation:
`About a given circle to circumscribe a square`.

Proof:
Let `ABCD` be the given circle; thus it is required to circumscribe a square about the circle `ABCD`.
Let two diameters `AC`, `BD` of the circle `ABCD` be drawn at right angles to one another, and through the points `A`, `B`, `C`, `D` let `FG`, `GH`, `HK`, `KF` be drawn touching the circle `ABCD`. [elem.3.16.p.1]
Then, since `FG` touches the circle `ABCD`, and `EA` has been joined from the centre `E` to the point of contact at `A`,
For the same reason
Now, since the angle `AEB` is right, and the angle `EBG` is also right,
For the same reason
Similarly we can prove that
Therefore `GK`, `GC`, `AK`, `FB`, `BK` are parallelograms; therefore `GF` is equal to `HK`, and `GH` to `FK`. [elem.1.34]
And, since `AC` is equal to `BD`, and `AC` is also equal to each of the straight lines `GH`, `FK`,
I say next that it is also right-angled.
For, since `GBEA` is a parallelogram, and the angle `AEB` is right, therefore the angle `AGB` is also right. [elem.1.34]
Similarly we can prove that
Therefore `FGHK` is right-angled.
But it was also proved equilateral;  and it has been circumscribed about the circle `ABCD`.
Therefore about the given circle a square has been circumscribed. Q. E. F.
