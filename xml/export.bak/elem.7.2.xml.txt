Proof:
Let ,  be the two given numbers not prime to one another.
Thus it is required to find the greatest common measure of , .
If now  measures —and it also measures itself— is a common measure of , .
And it is manifest that it is also the greatest; for no greater number than  will measure .
But, if  does not measure , then, the less of the numbers ,  being continually subtracted from the greater, some number will be left which will measure the one before it.
For an unit will not be left; otherwise ,  will be prime to one another [elem.7.1], which is contrary to the hypothesis.
Therefore some number will be left which will measure the one before it.
Now let , measuring , leave  less than itself, let , measuring , leave  less than itself, and let  measure .
Since then,  measures , and  measures , therefore  will also measure .
But it also measures itself; therefore it will also measure the whole .
But  measures ; therefore  also measures .
But it also measures ; therefore it will also measure the whole .
But it also measures ; therefore  measures , .
Therefore  is a common measure of , .
I say next that it is also the greatest.
For, if  is not the greatest common measure of , , some number which is greater than  will measure the numbers , .
Let such a number measure them, and let it be .
Now, since  measures , while  measures ,  also measures .
But it also measures the whole ; therefore it will also measure the remainder .
But  measures ; therefore  will also measure .
But it also measures the whole ; therefore it will also measure the remainder , that is, the greater will measure the less: which is impossible.
Therefore no number which is greater than  will measure the numbers , ;
