Proof:
For let the composite number  by multiplying any number  make ; I say that  is solid.
For, since  is composite, it will be measured by some number. [elem.7.def.13]
Let it be measured by ; and, as many times as  measures , so many units let there be in .
Since then  measures  according to the units in , therefore  by multiplying  has made . [elem.7.def.15]
And, since  by multiplying  has made , and  is the product of , , therefore the product of ,  by multiplying  has made .
Therefore  is solid, and , ,  are its sides. Q. E. D.
