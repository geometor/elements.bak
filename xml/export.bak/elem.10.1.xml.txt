Proof:
Let  be two unequal magnitudes of which  is the greater: I say that, if from  there be subtracted a magnitude greater than its half, and from that which is left a magnitude greater than its half, and if this process be repeated continually, there will be left some magnitude which will be less than the magnitude .
For  if multiplied will sometime be greater than . [cf. elem.5.def.4]
Let it be multiplied, and let  be a multiple of , and greater than. ; let  be divided into the parts , ,  equal to , from  let there be subtracted  greater than its half, and, from ,  greater than its half, and let this process be repeated continually until the divisions in  are equal in multitude with the divisions in .
Let, then, , ,  be divisions which are equal in multitude with , , .
Now, since  is greater than , and from  there has been subtracted  less than its half, and, from ,  greater than its half, therefore the remainder  is greater than the remainder .
And, since  is greater than , and there has been subtracted, from , the half , and, from ,  greater than its half, therefore the remainder  is greater than the remainder .
But  is equal to ; therefore  is also greater than .
Therefore  is less than .
Therefore there is left of the magnitude  the magnitude  which is less than the lesser magnitude set out, namely . Q. E. D.
And the theorem can be similarly proved even if the parts subtracted be halves.
