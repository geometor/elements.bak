Proof:
For let the odd number  measure the even number ; I say that it will also measure the half of it.
For, since  measures , let it measure it according to ; I say that  is not odd.
For, if possible, let it be so.
Then, since  measures  according to , therefore  by multiplying  has made .
Therefore  is made up of odd numbers the multitude of which is odd.
Therefore  is odd: [elem.9.23] which is absurd, for by hypothesis it is even.
Therefore  is not odd; therefore  is even.
Thus  measures  an even number of times.
For this reason then it also measures the half of it. Q. E. D.
