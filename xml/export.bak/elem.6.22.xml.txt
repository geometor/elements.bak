Enunciation:
`If four straight lines be proportional`, `the rectilineal figures similar and similarly described upon them will also be proportional`; `and`, `if the rectilineal figures similar and similarly described upon them be proportional`, `the straight lines will themselves also be proportional`.

Proof:
Let the four straight lines `AB`, `CD`, `EF`, `GH` be proportional, so that, as `AB` is to `CD`, so is `EF` to `GH`, and let there be described on `AB`, `CD` the similar and similarly situated rectilineal figures `KAB`, `LCD`, and on `EF`, `GH` the similar and similarly situated rectilineal figures `MF`, `NH`; I say that, as `KAB` is to `LCD`, so is `MF` to `NH`.
For let there be taken a third proportional `O` to `AB`, `CD`, and a third proportional `P` to `EF`, `GH`. [elem.6.11]
Then since, as `AB` is to `CD`, so is `EF` to `GH`,  therefore, `ex aequali`, as `AB` is to `O`, so is `EF` to `P`. [elem.5.22]
But, as `AB` is to `O`, so is `KAB` to `LCD`, [elem.6.19.p.1]  therefore also, as `KAB` is to `LCD`, so is `MF` to `NH`. [elem.5.11]
Next, let `MF` be to `NH` as `KAB` is to `LCD`; I say also that, as `AB` is to `CD`, so is `EF` to `GH`.
For, if `EF` is not to `GH` as `AB` to `CD`,  and on `QR` let the rectilineal figure `SR` be described similar and similarly situated to either of the two `MF`, `NH`. [elem.6.18]
Since then, as `AB` is to `CD`, so is `EF` to `QR`, and there have been described on `AB`, `CD` the similar and similarly situated figures `KAB`, `LCD`, and on `EF`, `QR` the similar and similarly situated figures `MF`, `SR`, therefore, as `KAB` is to `LCD`, so is `MF` to `SR`.
But also, by hypothesis,
Therefore `MF` has the same ratio to each of the figures `NH`, `SR`;
But it is also similar and similarly situated to it;
And, since, as `AB` is to `CD`, so is `EF` to `QR`, while `QR` is equal to `GH`, therefore, as `AB` is to `CD`, so is `EF` to `GH`.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
