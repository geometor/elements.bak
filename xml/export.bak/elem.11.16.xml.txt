Proof:
For let the two parallel planes ,  be cut by the plane , and let ,  be their common sections; I say that  is parallel to .
For, if not, ,  will, when produced, meet either in the direction of ,  or of , .
Let them be produced, as in the direction of , , and let them, first, meet at .
Now, since  is in the plane , therefore all the points on  are also in the plane . [elem.11.1]
But  is one of the points on the straight line ; therefore  is in the plane .
For the same reason  is also in the plane ; therefore the planes ,  will meet when produced.
But they do not meet, because they are, by hypothesis, parallel; therefore the straight lines ,  will not meet when produced in the direction of , .
Similarly we can prove that neither will the straight lines ,  meet when produced in the direction of , .
But straight lines which do not meet in either direction are parallel. [elem.1.def.23]
Therefore  is parallel to .
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
