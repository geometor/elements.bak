Proof:
For let the two straight lines ,  cut one another at the point ; I say that ,  are in one plane, and every triangle is in one plane.
For let points ,  be taken at random on , , let ,  be joined, and let ,  be drawn across; I say first that the triangle  is in one plane.
For, if part of the triangle , either  or , is in the plane of reference, and the rest in another, a part also of one of the straight lines ,  will be in the plane of reference, and a part in another.
But, if the part  of the triangle  be in the plane of reference, and the rest in another, a part also of both the straight lines ,  will be in the plane of reference and a part in another: which was proved absurd. [elem.11.1]
Therefore the triangle  is in one plane.
But, in whatever plane the triangle  is, in that plane also is each of the straight lines , , and, in whatever plane each of the straight lines ,  is, in that plane are ,  also. [elem.11.1]
Therefore the straight lines ,  are in one plane, and every triangle is in one plane. Q. E. D.
