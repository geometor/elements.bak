Proof:
Let there be as many numbers as we please, , , , , beginning from an unit, and in continued proportion; I say that, by however many prime numbers  is measured,  will also be measured by the same.
For let  be measured by any prime number ; I say that  measures .
For suppose it does not; now  is prime, and any prime number is prime to any which it does not measure; [elem.7.29] therefore ,  are prime to one another.
And, since  measures , let it measure it according to , therefore  by multiplying  has made .
Again, since  measures  according to the units in , [elem.9.11 elem.9.11.p.1] therefore  by multiplying  has made .
But, further,  has also by multiplying  made ; therefore the product of ,  is equal to the product of , .
Therefore, as  is to , so is  to . [elem.7.19]
But ,  are prime, primes are also least, [elem.7.21] and the least measure those which have the same ratio the same number of times, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent; [elem.7.20] therefore  measures .
Let it measure it according to ; therefore  by multiplying  has made .
But, further, by the theorem before this,  has also by multiplying  made . [elem.9.11 elem.9.11.p.1]
Therefore the product of ,  is equal to the product of , .
Therefore, as  is to , so is  to . [elem.7.19]
But ,  are prime, primes are also least, [elem.7.21] and the least numbers measure those which have the same ratio with them the same number of times, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent: [elem.7.20] therefore  measures .
Let it measure it according to ; therefore  by multiplying  has made .
But further  has also by multiplying itself made ; [elem.9.8] therefore the product of ,  is equal to the square on .
Therefore, as  is to , so is  to . [elem.7.19]
But ,  are prime, primes are also least, [elem.7.21] and the least measure those which have the same ratio the same number of times, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent; [elem.7.20] therefore  measures , as antecedent antecedent.
But, again, it also does not measure it: which is impossible.
Therefore ,  are not prime to one another.
Therefore they are composite to one another.
But numbers composite to one another are measured by some number. [elem.7.def.14]
And, since  is by hypothesis prime, and the prime is not measured by any number other than itself, therefore  measures , , so that  measures .
[But it also measures ; therefore  measures , .]
Similarly we can prove that, by however many prime numbers  is measured,  will also be measured by the same. Q. E. D.
