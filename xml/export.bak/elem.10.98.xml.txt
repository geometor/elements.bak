Proof:
Let  be a first apotome of a medial straight line and  a rational straight line, and to  let there be applied  equal to the square on , producing  as breadth; I say that  is a second apotome.
For let  be the annex to ;. therefore ,  are medial straight lines commensurable in square only which contain a rational rectangle. [elem.10.74]
To  let there be applied  equal to the square on , producing  as breadth, and  equal to the square on , producing  as breadth; therefore the whole  is equal to the squares on , ; therefore  is also medial. [elem.10.15 elem.10.23.p.1]
And it is applied to the rational straight line , producing  as breadth; therefore  is rational and incommensurable in length with . [elem.10.22]
Now, since  is equal to the squares on , , and, in these, the square on  is equal to , therefore the remainder, twice the rectangle , , is equal to . [elem.2.7]
But twice the rectangle ,  is rational; therefore  is rational.
And it is applied to the rational straight line , producing  as breadth; therefore  is also rational and commensurable in length with . [elem.10.20]
Now, since the sum of the squares on , , that is, , is medial, while twice the rectangle , , that is, , is rational, therefore  is incommensurable with .
But, as  is to , so is  to ; [elem.6.1] therefore  is incommensurable in length with . [elem.10.11]
And both are rational; therefore ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore  is an apotome. [elem.10.73]
I say next that it is also a second apotome.
For let  be bisected at , and let  be drawn through  parallel to ; therefore each of the rectangles ,  is equal to the rectangle , .
Now, since the rectangle ,  is a mean proportional between the squares on , , and the square on  is equal to , the rectangle ,  to , and the square on  to , therefore  is also a mean proportional between , ; therefore, as  is to , so is  to .
But, as  is to , so is  to , and, as  is to , so is  to ; [elem.6.1] therefore, as  is to , so is , so is ; [elem.5.11] therefore the rectangle ,  is equal to the square on  [elem.6.17], that is, to the fourth part of the square on .
Since the ,  are two unequal straight lines, and the rectangle ,  equal to the fourth part of the square on  and deficient by a square figure has been applied to the greater, , and divides it into commensurable parts, therefore the square on  is greater than the square on  by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with . [elem.10.17]
And the annex  is commensurable in length with the rational straight line  set out; therefore  is a second apotome. [elem.10.def.3.2]
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
