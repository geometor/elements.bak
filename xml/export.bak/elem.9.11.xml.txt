Enunciation:


Proof:
Let there be as many numbers as we please, , , , , beginning from the unit  and in continued proportion; I say that , the least of the numbers , , , , measures  according to some one of the numbers , .
For since, as the unit  is to , so is  to , therefore the unit  measures the number  the same number of times as  measures ; therefore, alternately, the unit  measures  the same number of times as  measures . [elem.7.15]
But the unit  measures  according to the units in it; therefore  also measures  according to the units in ; so that  the less measures  the greater according to some number of those which have place among the proportional numbers.â€”
