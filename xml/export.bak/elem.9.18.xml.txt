Proof:
Let ,  be the given two numbers, and let it be required to investigate whether it is possible to find a third proportional to them.
Now ,  are either prime to one another or not.
And, if they are prime to one another, it has been proved that it is impossible to find a third proportional to them. [elem.9.16]
Next, let ,  not be prime to one another, and let  by multiplying itself make .
Then  either measures  or does not measure it.
First, let it measure it according to ; therefore  by multiplying  has made .
But, further,  has also by multiplying itself made ; therefore the product of ,  is equal to the square on .
Therefore, as  is to , so is  to ; [elem.7.19] therefore a third proportional number  has been found to , .
Next, let  not measure ; I say that it is impossible to find a third proportional number to , .
For, if possible, let , such third proportional, have been found.
Therefore the product of ,  is equal to the square on .
But the square on  is ; therefore the product of ,  is equal to .
Hence  by multiplying  has made ; therefore  measures  according to .
But, by hypothesis, it also does not measure it: which is absurd.
Therefore it is not possible to find a third proportional number to ,  when  does not measure . Q. E. D.
