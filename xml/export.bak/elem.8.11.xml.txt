Proof:
Let ,  be square numbers, and let  be the side of , and  of ; I say that between ,  there is one mean proportional number, and  has to  the ratio duplicate of that which  has to .
For let  by multiplying  make .
Now, since  is a square and  is its side, therefore  by multiplying itself has made .
For the same reason also  by multiplying itself has made .
Since then  by multiplying the numbers ,  has made ,  respectively, therefore, as  is to , so is  to . [elem.7.17]
For the same reason also,
Therefore also, as  is to , so is  to .
Therefore between ,  there is one mean proportional number.
I say next that  also has to  the ratio duplicate of that which  has to .
For, since , ,  are three numbers in proportion, therefore  has to  the ratio duplicate of that which  has to . [elem.5.def.9]
But, as  is to , so is  to .
Therefore  has to  the ratio duplicate of that which the side  has to . Q. E. D.
