Proof:
For let the number  be the same parts of the number  that  subtracted is of  subtracted; I say that the remainder  is also the same parts of the remainder  that the whole  is of the whole .
For let  be made equal to .
Therefore, whatever parts  is of , the same parts also is  of .
Let  be divided into the parts of , namely , , and  into the parts of , namely , ; thus the multitude of ,  will be equal to the multitude of , .
Now since, whatever part  is of , the same part also is  of , while.  is greater than , therefore  is also greater than .
Let  be made equal to .
Therefore, whatever part  is of , the same part also is  of ; therefore also the remainder  is the same part of the remainder  that the whole  is of the whole . [elem.7.7]
Again, since, whatever part  is of , the same part also is  of , while  is greater than , therefore  is also greater than .
Let  be made equal to .
Therefore, whatever part  is of , the same part also is  of ; therefore also the remainder  is the same part of the remainder  that the whole  is of the whole . [elem.7.7]
But the remainder  was also proved to be the same part of the remainder  that the whole  is of the whole ; therefore also the sum of ,  is the same parts of  that the whole  is of the whole .
But the sum of ,  is equal to , and  is equal to ; therefore the remainder  is the same parts of the remainder  that the whole  is of the whole . Q. E. D.
