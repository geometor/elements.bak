Proof:
Let  be a circle; of the figures inscribed in the circle  let  be the side of a decagon,  that of a hexagon, and let them be in a straight line; I say that the whole straight line  has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, and  is its greater segment.
For let the centre of the circle, the point , be taken, let , ,  be joined, and let  be carried through to .
Since  is the side of an equilateral decagon, therefore the circumference  is five times the circumference ; therefore the circumference  is quadruple of .
But, as the circumference  is to , so is the angle  to the angle ; [elem.6.33] therefore the angle  is quadruple of the angle .
And, since the angle  is equal to the angle , [elem.1.5] therefore the angle  is double of the angle . [elem.1.32]
And, since the straight line  is equal to , for each of them is equal to the side of the hexagon inscribed in the circle , [elem.4.15.p.1] the angle  is also equal to the angle ; [elem.1.5] therefore the angle  is double of the angle . [elem.1.32]
But the angle  was proved double of the angle ; therefore the angle  is quadruple of the angle .
But the angle  was also proved quadruple of the angle ; therefore the angle  is equal to the angle .
But the angle  is common to the two triangles  and ; therefore the remaining angle  is also equal to the remaining angle ; [elem.1.32] therefore the triangle  is equiangular with the triangle .
Therefore, proportionally, as  is to , so is  to . [elem.6.4]
But  is equal to .
Therefore, as  is to , so is  to .
And  is greater than ; therefore  is also greater than .
Therefore the straight line  has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, and  is its greater segment. Q. E. D.
