Proof:
For let there be set out any rational straight line , and two square numbers ,  such that their difference  is not square; [elem.10.28.l.1] let there be described on  the semicircle , and let it be contrived that,
Let  be joined.
Since, as the square on  is to the square on , so is  to , therefore the square on  has to the square on  the ratio which the number  has to the number ; therefore the square on  is commensurable with the square on . [elem.10.6]
But the square on  is rational; [elem.10.def.4] therefore the square on  is also rational; [] therefore  is also rational.
And, since  has not to  the ratio which a square number has to a square number, neither has the square on  to the square on  the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore  is incommensurable in length with . [elem.10.9]
Therefore ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only.
And since, as  is to , so is the square on  to the square on , therefore, , as  is to , so is the square on  to the square on . [elem.5.19.p.1, elem.3.31, elem.1.47]
But  has to  the ratio which a square number has to a square number: therefore also the square on  has to the square on  the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore  is commensurable in length with . [elem.10.9]
And the square on  is equal to the squares on , ; therefore the square on  is greater than the square on  by the square on  commensurable with .
Therefore there have been found two rational straight lines ,  commensurable in square only and such that the square on the greater  is greater than the square on the less  by the square on  commensurable in length with .
