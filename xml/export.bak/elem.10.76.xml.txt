Proof:
For from the straight line  let there be subtracted the straight line  which is incommensurable in square with the whole and fulfils the given conditions. [elem.10.33]
I say that the remainder  is the irrational straight line called .
For, since the sum of the squares on ,  is , while twice the rectangle ,  is medial, therefore the squares on ,  are incommensurable with twice the rectangle , ; and, , the squares on ,  are incommensurable with the remainder, the square on . [elem.2.7, elem.10.16]
But the squares on ,  are rational; therefore the square on  is irrational; therefore  is irrational.
And let it be called .
