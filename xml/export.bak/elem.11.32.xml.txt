Proof:
Let ,  be parallelepipedal solids of the same height; I say that the parallelepipedal solids ,  are to one another as their bases, that is, that, as the base  is to the base , so is the solid  to the solid .
For let  equal to  be applied to , [elem.1.45] and on  as base, and with the same height as that of , let the parallelepipedal solid  be completed.
Then the solid  is equal to the solid ; for they are on equal bases ,  and of the same height. [elem.11.31]
And, since the parallelepipedal solid  is cut by the plane  which is parallel to opposite planes, therefore, as the base  is to the base , so is the solid  to the solid . [elem.11.25]
But the base  is equal to the base , and the solid  to the solid ; therefore also, as the base  is to the base , so is the solid  to the solid .
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
