Proof:
For let the two straight lines ,  meeting one another be parallel to the two straight lines ,  meeting one another, not in the same plane; I say that the angle  is equal to the angle .
For let , , ,  be cut off equal to one another, and let , , , ,  be joined.
Now, since  is equal and parallel to , therefore  is also equal and parallel to . [elem.1.33]
For the same reason  is also equal and parallel to .
Therefore each of the straight lines ,  is equal and parallel to .
But straight lines which are parallel to the same straight line and are not in the same plane with it are parallel to one another; [elem.11.9] therefore  is parallel and equal to .
And ,  join them; therefore  is also equal and parallel to . [elem.1.33]
Now, since the two sides ,  are equal to the two sides , , and the base  is equal to the base , therefore the angle  is equal to the angle . [elem.1.8]
Therefore etc.
