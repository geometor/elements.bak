Proof:
Let , ,  be the given parts; thus it is required to find the number which is the least that will have the parts , , .
Let , ,  be numbers called by the same name as the parts , , , and let , the least number measured by , , , be taken. [elem.7.36]
Therefore  has parts called by the same name as , , . [elem.7.37]
But , ,  are parts called by the same name as , , ; therefore  has the parts , , .
I say next that it is also the least number that has.
For, if not, there will be some number less than  which will have the parts , , .
Let it be .
Since  has the parts , , , therefore  will be measured by numbers called by the same name as the parts , , . [elem.7.38]
But , ,  are numbers called by the same name as the parts , , ; therefore  is measured by , , .
And it is less than  : which is impossible.
Therefore there will be no number less than  that will have the parts , , . Q. E. D.
