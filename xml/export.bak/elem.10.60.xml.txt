Proof:
Let  be a binomial straight line divided into its terms at , so that  is the greater term; let a rational straight line  be set out, and let  equal to the square on  be applied to  producing  as its breadth; I say that  is a first binomial straight line.
For let there be applied to  the rectangle  equal to the square on , and  equal to the square on ; therefore the remainder, twice the rectangle , , is equal to .
Let  be bisected at , and let  be drawn parallel [to  or ].
Therefore each of the rectangles ,  is equal to once the rectangle , .
Now, since  is a binomial divided into its terms at , therefore ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; [elem.10.36] therefore the squares on ,  are rational and commensurable with one another, so that the sum of the squares on ,  is also rational. [elem.10.15]
And it is equal to ; therefore  is rational.
And it is applied to the rational straight line ; therefore  is rational and commensurable in length with . [elem.10.20]
Again, since ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, therefore twice the rectangle , , that is , is medial. [elem.10.21]
And it is applied to the rational straight line ; therefore  is also rational and incommensurable in length with , that is, . [elem.10.22]
But  is also rational and is commensurable in length with ; therefore  is incommensurable in length with . [elem.10.13]
And they are rational; therefore ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore  is binomial. [elem.10.36]
It is next to be proved that it is also a first binomial straight line.
Since the rectangle ,  is a mean proportional between the squares on , , [cf. elem.10.53.l.1] therefore  is also a mean proportional between , .
Therefore, as  is to , so is  to , that is, as  is to , so is  to ; [elem.6.1] therefore the rectangle ,  is equal to the square on . [elem.6.17]
And, since the square on  is commensurable with the square on ,  is also commensurable with , so that  is also commensurable with . [elem.6.1, elem.10.11]
And, since the squares on ,  are greater than twice the rectangle , , [elem.10.59.l.1] therefore  is also greater than , so that  is also greater than . [elem.6.1]
And the rectangle ,  is equal to the square on , that is, to the fourth part of the square on , and  is commensurable with .
But, if there be two unequal straight lines, and to the greater there be applied a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on the less and deficient by a square figure, and if it divide it into commensurable parts, the square on the greater is greater than the square on the less by the square on a straight line commensurable with the greater; [elem.10.17] therefore the square on  is greater than the square on  by the square on a straight line commensurable with .
And ,  are rational, and , which is the greater term, is commensurable in length with the rational straight line  set out.
Therefore  is a first binomial straight line. [elem.10.def.2.1] Q. E. D.
