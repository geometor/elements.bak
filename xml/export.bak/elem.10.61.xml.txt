Proof:
Let  be a first bimedial straight line divided into its medials at , of which medials  is the greater; let a rational straight line  be set out, and let there be applied to  the parallelogram  equal to the square on , producing  as its breadth; I say that  is a second binominal straight line.
For let the same construction as before be made.
Then, since  is a first bimedial divided at , therefore ,  are medial straight lines commensurable in square only, and containing a rational rectangle, [elem.10.37] so that the squares on ,  are also medial. [elem.10.21]
Therefore  is medial. [elem.10.15 elem.10.23.p.1]
And it has been applied to the rational straight line ; therefore  is rational and incommensurable in length with . [elem.10.22]
Again, since twice the rectangle ,  is rational,  is also rational.
And it is applied to the rational straight line ; therefore  is also rational and commensurable in length with , that is, ; [elem.10.20] therefore  is incommensurable in length with . [elem.10.13]
And they are rational; therefore ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore  is binomial. [elem.10.36]
It is next to be proved that it is also a second binomial straight line.
For, since the squares on ,  are greater than twice the rectangle , , therefore  is also greater than , so that  is also greater than . [elem.6.1]
And, since the square on  is commensurable with the square on ,  is also commensurable with , so that  is also commensurable with . [elem.6.1, elem.10.11]
And the rectangle ,  is equal to the square on ; therefore the square on  is greater than the square on  by the square on a straight line commensurable with . [elem.10.17]
And  is commensurable is length with .
Therefore  is a second binomial straight line. [elem.10.def.2.2]
