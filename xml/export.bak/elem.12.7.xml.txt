Proof:
Let there be a prism in which the triangle  is the base and  its opposite; I say that the prism  is divided into three pyramids equal to one another, which have triangular bases.
For let , ,  be joined.
Since  is a parallelogram, and  is its diameter, therefore the triangle  is equal to the triangle ; [elem.1.34] therefore also the pyramid of which the triangle  is the base and the point  the vertex is equal to the pyramid of which the triangle  is the base and the point  the vertex. [elem.12.5]
But the pyramid of which the triangle  is the base and the point  the vertex is the same with the pyramid of which the triangle  is the base and the point  the vertex; for they are contained by the same planes.
Therefore the pyramid of which the triangle  is the base and the point  the vertex is also equal to the pyramid of which the triangle  is the base and the point  the vertex.
Again, since  is a parallelogram, and  is its diameter, the triangle  is equal to the triangle . [elem.1.34]
Therefore also the pyramid of which the triangle  is the base and the point  the vertex is equal to the pyramid of which the triangle  is the base and the point  the vertex. [elem.12.5]
But the pyramid of which the triangle  is the base and the point  the vertex was proved equal to the pyramid of which the triangle  is the base and the point  the vertex; therefore also the pyramid of which the triangle  is the base and the point  the vertex is equal to the pyramid of which the triangle  is the base and the point  the vertex; therefore the prism  has been divided into three pyramids equal to one another which have triangular bases.
And, since the pyramid of which the triangle  is the base and the point  the vertex is the same with the pyramid of which the triangle  is the base and the point  the vertex, for they are contained by the same planes, while the pyramid of which the triangle  is the base and the point  the vertex was proved to be a third of the prism in which the triangle  is the base and  its opposite, therefore also the pyramid of which the triangle  is the base and the point  the vertex is a third of the prism which has the same base, the triangle , and  as its opposite.
