Proof:
Let the two given commensurable magnitudes be ,  of which  is the less; thus it is required to find the greatest common measure of , .
Now the magnitude  either measures  or it does not.
If then it measures it—and it measures itself also— is a common measure of , .
And it is manifest that it is also the greatest; for a greater magnitude than the magnitude  will not measure .
Next, let  not measure .
Then, if the less be continually subtracted in turn from the greater, that which is left over will sometime measure the one before it, because ,  are not incommensurable; [cf. elem.10.2] let , measuring , leave  less than itself, let , measuring , leave  less than itself, and let  measure .
Since, then,  measures , while  measures , therefore  will also measure .
But it measures itself also; therefore  will also measure the whole .
But  measures ; therefore  will also measure .
But it measures  also; therefore it also measures the whole .
Therefore  is a common measure of , .
I say next that it is also the greatest.
For, if not, there will be some magnitude greater than  which will measure , .
Let it be .
Since then  measures , while  measures , therefore  will also measure .
But it measures the whole  also; therefore  will also measure the remainder .
But  measures ; therefore  will also measure .
But it measures the whole  also, and it will therefore measure the remainder , the greater the less: which is impossible.
Therefore no magnitude greater than  will measure , ; therefore  is the greatest common measure of , .
Therefore the greatest common measure of the two given commensurable magnitudes ,  has been found. Q. E. D.
