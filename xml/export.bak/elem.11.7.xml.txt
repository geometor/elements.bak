Proof:
Let ,  be two parallel straight lines, and let points ,  be taken at random on them respectively; I say that the straight line joining the points ,  is in the same plane with the parallel straight lines.
For suppose it is not, but, if possible, let it be in a more elevated plane as , and let a plane be drawn through ; it will then make, as section in the plane of reference, a straight line. [elem.11.3]
Let it make it, as ; therefore the two straight lines ,  will enclose an area: which is impossible.
Therefore the straight line joined from  to  is not in a plane more elevated; therefore the straight line joined from  to  is in the plane through the parallel straight lines , .
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
