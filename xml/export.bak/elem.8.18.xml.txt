Proof:
Let ,  be two similar plane numbers, and let the numbers ,  be the sides of , and ,  of .
Now, since similar plane numbers are those which have their sides proportional, [elem.7.def.21] therefore, as  is to , so is  to .
I say then that between ,  there is one mean proportional number, and  has to  the ratio duplicate of that which  has to , or  to , that is, of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding side.
Now since, as  is to , so is  to , therefore, alternately, as  is to , so is  to . [elem.7.13]
And, since  is plane, and ,  are its sides, therefore  by multiplying  has made .
For the same reason also  by multiplying  has made .
Now let  by multiplying  make .
Then, since  by multiplying  has made , and by multiplying  has made , therefore, as  is to , so is  to . [elem.7.17]
But, as  is to , so is  to ; therefore also, as  is to , so is  to .
Again, since  by multiplying  has made , and by multiplying  has made , therefore, as  is to , so is  to . [elem.7.17]
But it was also proved that,  therefore also, as  is to , so is  to .
Therefore , ,  are in continued proportion.
Therefore between ,  there is one mean proportional number.
I say next that  also has to  the ratio duplicate of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding side, that is, of that which  has to  or  to .
For, since , ,  are in continued proportion,  has to  the ratio duplicate of that which it has to . [elem.5.def.9]
And, as  is to , so is  to , and so is  to .
Therefore  also has to  the ratio duplicate of that which  has to  or  to . Q. E. D.
