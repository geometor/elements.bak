Enunciation:
In any triangle, if one of the sides be produced, the exterior angle is greater than either of the interior and opposite angles.

Proof:
Let `ABC` be a triangle, and let one side of it `BC` be produced to `D`;
I say that the exterior angle `ACD` is greater than either of the interior and opposite angles `CBA`, `BAC`.
Let `AC` be bisected at `E` [elem.1.10], and let `BE` be joined and produced in a straight line to `F`;
let `EF` be made equal to `BE`[elem.1.3], let `FC` be joined [elem.1.post.1], and let `AC` be drawn through to `G` [elem.1.post.2].
Then, since `AE` is equal to `EC`, and `BE` to `EF`,
But the angle `ECD` is greater than the angle `ECF`; [. 5]
Similarly also, if `BC` be bisected, the angle `BCG`, that is, the angle `ACD` [elem.1.15], can be proved greater than the angle `ABC` as well.
Therefore etc.
