Proof:
For from the rational area  let the medial area  be subtracted; I say that the 
 of the remainder  becomes one of two irrational straight lines, either an apotome or a minor straight line.
For let a rational straight line  be set out, to  let there be applied the rectangular parallelogram  equal to , and let  equal to  be subtracted; therefore the remainder  is equal to .
Since then  is rational, and  medial, while  is equal to , and  to , therefore  is rational, and  medial.
And they are applied to the rational straight line ; therefore  is rational and commensurable in length with , [elem.10.20] while  is rational and incommensurable in length with ; [elem.10.22] therefore  is incommensurable in length with . [elem.10.13]
Therefore ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore  is an apotome [elem.10.73], and  the annex to it.
Now the square on  is greater than the square on  by the square on a straight line either commensurable with  or not commensurable.
First, let the square on it be greater by the square on a straight line commensurable with it.
Now the whole  is commensurable in length with the rational straight line  set out; therefore  is a first apotome. [elem.10.def.3.1]
But the 
 of the rectangle contained by a rational straight line and a first apotome is an apotome. [elem.10.91]
Therefore the 
 of , that is, of , is an apotome.
But, if the square on  is greater than the square on  by the square on a straight line incommensurable with , while the whole  is commensurable in length with the rational straight line  set out,  is a fourth apotome. [elem.10.def.3.4]
But the 
 of the rectangle contained by a rational straight line and a fourth apotome is minor. [elem.10.94] Q. E. D.
