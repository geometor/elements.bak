Proof:
Let  be a rational straight line and  an apotome, and let the rectangle ,  be equal to the square on , so that the square on the rational straight line  when applied to the apotome  produces  as breadth; I say that  is a binomial straight line the terms of which are commensurable with the terms of  and in the same ratio; and further  has the same order as .
For let  be the annex to ; therefore ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only. [elem.10.73]
Let the rectangle ,  be also equal to the square on .
But the square on  is rational; therefore the rectangle ,  is also rational.
And it has been applied to the rational straight line ; therefore  is rational and commensurable in length with . [elem.10.20]
Since now the rectangle ,  is equal to the rectangle , , therefore, proportionally, as  is to , so is  to . [elem.6.16]
But  is greater than ; therefore  is also greater than . [elem.5.16, elem.5.14]
Let  be made equal to ; therefore  is commensurable in length with .
And since, as  is to , so is  to , therefore, , as  is to , so is  to . [elem.5.19.p.1]
Let it be contrived that, as  is to , so is  to ; therefore also the remainder  is to  as  is to , that is, as  is to . [elem.5.19]
But ,  are commensurable in square only; therefore ,  are also commensurable in square only. [elem.10.11]
And since, as  is to , so is  to , while, as  is to , so is  to , therefore also, as  is to , so is  to , [elem.5.11] so that also, as the first is to the third, so is the square on the first to the square on the second; [elem.5.def.9] therefore also, as  is to , so is the square on  to the square on .
But the square on  is commensurable with the square on , for ,  are commensurable in square; therefore  is also commensurable in length with , [elem.10.11] so that  is also commensurable in length with . [elem.10.15]
But  is rational and commensurable in length with ; therefore  is also rational and commensurable in length with . [elem.10.12]
And, since, as  is to , so is  to , alternately, as  is to , so is  to . [elem.5.16]
But  is commensurable with ; therefore  is also commensurable in length with . [elem.10.11]
But ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore ,  are also rational straight lines [elem.10.def.3] commensurable in square only; therefore  is binomial. [elem.10.36]
If now the square on  is greater than the square on  by the square on a straight line commensurable with , the square on  will also be greater than the square on  by the square on a straight line commensurable with . [elem.10.14]
And, if  is commensurable in length with the rational straight line set out, so also is ; if  is commensurable in length with the rational straight line set out, so also is , but, if neither of the straight lines , , then neither of the straight lines , .
But, if the square on  is greater than the square on  by the square on a straight line incommensurable with , the square on  is also greater than the square on  by the square on a straight line incommensurable with . [elem.10.14]
And, if  is commensurable with the rational straight line set out, so also is ; if  is so commensurable, in length with the rational straight line set out, so also is ; but, if neither of the straight lines , , then neither of the straight lines , .
Therefore  is a binomial straight line, the terms of which ,  are commensurable with the terms ,  of the apotome and in the same ratio, and further  has the same order as . Q. E. D.
