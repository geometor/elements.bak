`If three straight lines be proportional`, `the rectangle contained by the extremes is equal to the square on the mean`; `and`, `if the rectangle contained by the extremes be equal to the square on the mean`, `the three straight lines will be proportional`.

Proof:
Let the three straight lines `A`, `B`, `C` be proportional, so that, as `A` is to `B`, so is `B` to `C`; I say that the rectangle contained by `A`, `C` is equal to the square on `B`.
Let `D` be made equal to `B`.
Then, since, as `A` is to `B`, so is `B` to `C`, and `B` is equal to `D`, therefore, as `A` is to `B`, so is `D` to `C`.
But, if four straight lines be proportional, the rectangle contained by the extremes is equal to the rectangle contained by the means. [elem.6.16]
Therefore the rectangle `A`, `C` is equal to the rectangle `B`, `D`.
But the rectangle `B`, `D` is the square on `B`, for `B` is equal to `D`; therefore the rectangle contained by `A`, `C` is equal to the square on `B`.
Next, let the rectangle `A`, `C` be equal to the square on `B`; I say that, as `A` is to `B`, so is `B` to `C`.
For, with the same construction, since the rectangle `A`, `C` is equal to the square on `B`, while the square on `B` is the rectangle `B`, `D`, for `B` is equal to `D`, therefore the rectangle `A`, `C` is equal to the rectangle `B`, `D`.
But, if the rectangle contained by the extremes be equal to that contained by the means, the four straight lines are proportional. [elem.6.16]
Therefore, as `A` is to `B`, so is `D` to `C`.
But `B` is equal to `D`;
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
