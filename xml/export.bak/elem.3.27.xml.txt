Enunciation:
`In equal circles angles standing on equal circumferences are equal to one another`, `whether they stand at the centres or at the circumferences`.

Proof:
For in equal circles `ABC`, `DEF`, on equal circumferences `BC`, `EF`, let the angles `BGC`, `EHF` stand at the centres `G`, `H`, and the angles `BAC`, `EDF` at the circumferences; I say that the angle `BGC` is equal to the angle `EHF`, and the angle `BAC` is equal to the angle `EDF`.
For, if the angle `BGC` is unequal to the angle `EHF`,  Let the angle `BGC` be greater : and on the straight line `BG`, and at the point `G` on it, let the angle `BGK` be constructed equal to the angle `EHF`. [elem.1.23]
Now equal angles stand on equal circumferences, when they are at the centres; [elem.3.26]
But `EF` is equal to `BC`;
Therefore the angle `BGC` is not unequal to the angle `EHF`;
And the angle at `A` is half of the angle `BGC`,  therefore the angle at `A` is also equal to the angle at `D`.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
