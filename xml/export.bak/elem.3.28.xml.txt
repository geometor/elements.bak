Enunciation:
`In equal circles equal straight lines cut off equal circumferences`, `the greater equal to the greater and the less to the less`.

Proof:
Let `ABC`, `DEF` be equal circles, and in the circles let `AB`, `DE` be equal straight lines cutting off `ACB`, `DFE` as greater circumferences and `AGB`, `DHE` as lesser; I say that the greater circumference `ACB` is equal to the greater circumference `DFE`, and the less circumference `AGB` to `DHE`.
For let the centres `K`, `L` of the circles be taken, and let `AK`, `KB`, `DL`, `LE` be joined.
Now, since the circles are equal,  and the base `AB` is equal to the base `DE`;
But equal angles stand on equal circumferences, when they are at the centres; [elem.3.26]
And the whole circle `ABC` is also equal to the whole circle `DEF`; therefore the circumference `ACB` which remains is also equal to the circumference `DFE` which remains.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
