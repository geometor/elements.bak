Proof:
For let the area  be contained by the rational straight line  and the first binomial ; I say that the 
 of the area  is the irrational straight line which is called binomial.
For, since  is a first binomial straight line, let it be divided into its terms at , and let  be the greater term.
It is then manifest that ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, the square on  is greater than the square on  by the square on a straight line commensurable with , and  is commensurable in length with the rational straight line  set out. [elem.10.def.2.1]
Let  be bisected at the point .
Then, since the square on  is greater than the square on  by the square on a straight line commensurable with , therefore, if there be applied to the greater  a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on the less, that is, to the square on , and deficient by a square figure, it divides it into commensurable parts. [elem.10.17]
Let then the rectangle ,  equal to the square on  be applied to ; therefore  is commensurable in length with .
Let , ,  be drawn from , ,  parallel to either of the straight lines , ; let the square  be constructed equal to the parallelogram , and the square  equal to , [elem.2.14] and let them be placed so that  is in a straight line with ; therefore  is also in a straight line with .
And let the parallelogram  be completed; therefore  is a square. [Lemma]
Now, since the rectangle ,  is equal to the square on , therefore, as  is to , so is  to ; [elem.6.17] therefore also, as  is to , so is  to ; [elem.6.1] therefore  is a mean proportional between , .
But  is equal to , and  to ; therefore  is a mean proportional between , .
But  is also a mean proportional between the same , ; [Lemma] therefore  is equal to , so that it is also equal to .
But ,  are also equal to , ; therefore the whole  is equal to the whole , that is, to the square on ; therefore  is the 
 of .
I say next that  is binomial.
For, since  is commensurable with , therefore  is also commensurable with each of the straight lines , . [elem.10.15]
But  is also, by hypothesis, commensurable with ; therefore ,  are also commensurable with . [elem.10.12]
And  is rational; therefore each of the straight lines ,  is also rational; therefore each of the rectangles ,  is rational, [elem.10.19] and  is commensurable with .
But  is equal to , and  to ; therefore , , that is, the squares on , , are rational and commensurable.
And, since  is incommensurable in length with , while  is commensurable with , and  is commensurable with , therefore  is also incommensurable with , [elem.10.13] so that  is also incommensurable with . [elem.6.1, elem.10.11]
But  is equal to , and  to ; therefore  is also incommensurable with .
But, as  is to , so is  to ; [elem.6.1] therefore  is incommensurable with . [elem.10.11]
But  is equal to , and  to ; therefore  is incommensurable with .
And the square on  is commensurable with the square on , and each is rational; therefore ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only.
Therefore  is binomial [elem.10.36] and the 
 of . Q. E. D.
