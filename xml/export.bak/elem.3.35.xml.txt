Enunciation:
`If in a circle two straight lines cut one another`, `the rectangle contained by the segments of the one is equal to the rectangle contained by the segments of the other`.

Proof:
For in the circle `ABCD` let the two straight lines `AC`, `BD` cut one another at the point `E`; I say that the rectangle contained by `AE`, `EC` is equal to the rectangle contained by `DE`, `EB`.
If now `AC`, `BD` are through the centre, so that `E` is the centre of the circle `ABCD`, it is manifest that, `AE`, `EC`, `DE`, `EB` being equal, the rectangle contained by `AE`, `EC` is also equal to the rectangle contained by `DE`, `EB`.
Next let `AC`, `DB` not be through the centre; let the centre of `ABCD` be taken, and let it be `F`; from `F` let `FG`, `FH` be drawn perpendicular to the straight lines `AC`, `DB`, and let `FB`, `FC`, `FE` be joined.
Then, since a straight line `GF` through the centre cuts a straight line `AC` not through the centre at right angles,
Since, then, the straight line `AC` has been cut into equal parts at `G` and into unequal parts at `E`, the rectangle contained by `AE`, `EC` together with the square on `EG` is equal to the square on `GC`; [elem.2.5]
Let the square on `GF` be added; therefore the rectangle `AE`, `EC` together with the squares on `GE`, `GF` is equal to the squares on `CG`, `GF`.
But the square on `FE` is equal to the squares on `EG`, `GF`, and the square on `FC` is equal to the squares on `CG`, `GF`; [elem.1.47]
And `FC` is equal to `FB`; therefore the rectangle `AE`, `EC` together with the square on `EF` is equal to the square on `FB`.
For the same reason, also, the rectangle `DE`, `EB` together with the square on `FE` is equal to the square on `FB`.
But the rectangle `AE`, `EC` together with the square on `FE` was also proved equal to the square on `FB`; therefore the rectangle `AE`, `EC` together with the square on `FE` is equal to the rectangle `DE`, `EB` together with the square on `FE`.
Let the square on `FE` be subtracted from each; therefore the rectangle contained by `AE`, `EC` which remains is equal to the rectangle contained by `DE`, `EB`.
Therefore etc.
