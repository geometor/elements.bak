And, since  by multiplying itself has made , and by multiplying  has made  therefore, as  is to , so is  to . [elem.7.17]
And, since ,  are cube numbers, ,  are similar solid numbers.
Therefore two mean proportional numbers fall between , ; [elem.8.19] so that two mean proportional numbers will fall between ,  also. [elem.8.8]
