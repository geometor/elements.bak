Proof:
For let the rectangle  be contained by the rational straight lines ,  commensurable in length; I say that  is rational.
For on  let the square  be described; therefore  is rational. [elem.10.def.4]
And, since  is commensurable in length with , while  is equal to , therefore  is commensurable in length with .
And, as  is to , so is  to . [elem.6.1]
Therefore  is commensurable with . [elem.10.11]
But  is rational; therefore  is also rational. [elem.10.def.4]
Therefore etc.
