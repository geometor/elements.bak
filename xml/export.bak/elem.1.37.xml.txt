Enunciation:
Triangles which are on the same base and in the same parallels are equal to one another.

Proof:
Let `ABC`, `DBC` be triangles on the same base `BC` and in the same parallels `AD`, `BC`; I say that the triangle `ABC` is equal to the triangle `DBC`.
Let `AD` be produced in both directions to `E`, `F`; through `B` let `BE` be drawn parallel to `CA`, [elem.1.31] and through `C` let `CF` be drawn parallel to `BD`. [elem.1.31]
Then each of the figures `EBCA`, `DBCF` is a parallelogram; and they are equal,
for they are on the same base `BC` and in the same parallels `BC`, `EF`. [elem.1.35]
Moreover the triangle `ABC` is half of the parallelogram `EBCA`; for the diameter `AB` bisects it. [elem.1.34]
And the triangle `DBC` is half of the parallelogram `DBCF`; for the diameter `DC` bisects it. [elem.1.34]
[But the halves of equal things are equal to one another.]
Therefore the triangle `ABC` is equal to the triangle `DBC`.
Therefore etc.
