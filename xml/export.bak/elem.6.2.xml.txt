Enunciation:
`If a straight line be drawn parallel to one of the sides of a triangle`, `it will cut the sides of the triangle proportionally; and`, `if the sides of the triangle be cut proportionally`, `the line joining the points of section will be parallel to the remaining side of the triangle`.

Proof:
For let `DE` be drawn parallel to `BC`, one of the sides of the triangle `ABC`; I say that, as `BD` is to `DA`, so is `CE` to `EA`.
For let `BE`, `CD` be joined.
Therefore the triangle `BDE` is equal to  the triangle `CDE`; for they are on the same base `DE` and in the same parallels `DE`, `BC`. [elem.1.38]
And the triangle `ADE` is another area.
But equals have the same ratio to the same; [elem.5.7] therefore, as the triangle `BDE` is to the triangle `ADE`, so is the triangle `CDE` to the triangle `ADE`.
But, as the triangle `BDE` is to `ADE`, so is `BD` to `DA`; for, being under the same height, the perpendicular drawn from `E` to `AB`, they are to one another as their bases. [elem.6.1]
For the same reason also, as the triangle `CDE` is to `ADE`, so is `CE` to `EA`.
Therefore also, as `BD` is to `DA`, so is `CE` to `EA`. [elem.5.11]
Again, let the sides `AB`, `AC` of the triangle `ABC` be cut proportionally, so that, as `BD` is to `DA`, so is `CE` to `EA`; and let `DE` be joined.
I say that `DE` is parallel to `BC`.
For, with the same construction, since, as `BD` is to `DA`, so is `CE` to `EA`, but, as `BD` is to `DA`, so is the triangle `BDE` to the triangle `ADE`, and, as `CE` is to `EA`, so is the triangle `CDE` to the triangle `ADE`, [elem.6.1] therefore also,
Therefore each of the triangles `BDE`, `CDE` has the same ratio to `ADE`.
Therefore the triangle `BDE` is equal to the triangle `CDE`; [elem.5.9] and they are on the same base `DE`.
But equal triangles which are on the same base are also in the same parallels. [elem.1.39]
Therefore `DE` is parallel to `BC`.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
