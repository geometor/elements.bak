Proof:
Let ,  be parallelepipedal solids on the same base  and of the same height, and let the extremities of their sides which stand up, namely , , , , , , , , be on the same straight lines , ; I say that the solid  is equal to the solid .
For, since each of the figures ,  is a parallelogram,  is equal to each of the straight lines , , [elem.1.34] hence  is also equal to .
Let  be subtracted from each; therefore the remainder  is equal to the remainder .
Hence the triangle  is also equal to the triangle , [elem.1.8 elem.1.4] and the parallelogram  to the parallelogram . [elem.1.36]
For the same reason the triangle  is also equal to the triangle .
But the parallelogram  is equal to the parallelogram , and  to , for they are opposite; therefore the prism contained by the two triangles ,  and the three parallelograms , ,  is equal to the prism contained by the two triangles ,  and the three parallelograms , , .
Let there be added to each the solid of which the parallelogram  is the base and  its opposite; therefore the whole parallelepipedal solid  is equal to the whole parallelepipedal solid .
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
