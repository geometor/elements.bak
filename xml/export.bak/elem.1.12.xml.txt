Enunciation:
To a given infinite straight line, from a given point which is not on it, to draw a perpendicular straight line.

Proof:
Let `AB` be the given infinite straight line, and `C` the given point which is not on it; thus it is required to draw to the given infinite straight line `AB`, from the given point `C` which is not on it, a perpendicular straight line.
For let a point `D` be taken at random on the other side of the straight line `AB`, and with centre `C` and distance `CD` let the circle `EFG` be described; [elem.1.post.3]
I say that `CH` has been drawn perpendicular to the given infinite straight line `AB` from the given point `C` which is not on it.
For, since `GH` is equal to `HE`, and `HC` is common,  and the base `CG` is equal to the base `CE`;
But, when a straight line set up on a straight line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right, and the straight line standing on the other is called a perpendicular to that on which it stands. [elem.1.def.10]
Therefore `CH` has been drawn perpendicular to the given infinite straight line `AB` from the given point `C` which is not on it.
