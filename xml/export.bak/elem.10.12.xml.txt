Proof:
For let each of the magnitudes ,  be commensurable with ; I say that  is also commensurable with .
For, since  is commensurable with , therefore  has to  the ratio which a number has to a number. [elem.10.5]
Let it have the ratio which  has to .
Again, since  is commensurable with , therefore  has to  the ratio which a number has to a number. [elem.10.5]
Let it have the ratio which  has to .
And, given any number of ratios we please, namely the ratio which  has to  and that which  has to , let the numbers , ,  be taken continuously in the given ratios; [cf. elem.8.4] so that, as  is to , so is  to ,
Since, then, as  is to , so is  to , while, as  is to , so is  to , therefore also, as  is to , so is  to . [elem.5.11]
Again, since, as  is to , so is  to , while, as  is to , so is  to , therefore also, as  is to , so is  to . [elem.5.11]
But also, as  is to , so is  to ; therefore, , as  is to , so is  to . [elem.5.22]
Therefore  has to  the ratio which a number has to a number; therefore  is commensurable with . [elem.10.6]
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
