For let the cube number  by multiplying any number  make the cube number ; I say that  is cube.
For let  by multiplying itself make ; therefore  is cube. [elem.9.3]
Now, since  by multiplying itself has made , and by multiplying  has made , therefore, as  is to , so is  to . [elem.7.17]
And since ,  are cube, they are similar solid numbers.
Therefore two mean proportional numbers fall between , . [elem.8.19]
And, as  is to , so is  to ; therefore two mean proportional numbers fall between ,  also. [elem.8.8]
And  is cube; therefore  is also cube. [elem.8.23]
