Enunciation:
`If a first magnitude have to a second the same ratio as a third to a fourth`, `any equimultiples whatever of the first and third will also have the same ratio to any equimultiples whatever of the second and fourth respectively`, `taken in corresponding order`.

Proof:
For let a first magnitude `A` have to a second `B` the same ratio as a third `C` to a fourth `D`; and let equimultiples `E`, `F` be taken of `A`, `C`, and `G`, `H` other, chance, equimultiples of `B`, `D`; I say that, as `E` is to `G`, so is `F` to `H`.
For let equimultiples `K`, `L` be taken of `E`, `F`, and other, chance, equimultiples `M`, `N` of `G`, `H`.
Since `E` is the same multiple of `A` that `F` is of `C`, and equimultiples `K`, `L` of `E`, `F` have been taken, therefore `K` is the same multiple of `A` that `L` is of `C`. [elem.5.3]
For the same reason
And, since, as `A` is to `B`, so is `C` to `D`, and of `A`, `C` equimultiples `K`, `L` have been taken, and of `B`, `D` other, chance, equimultiples `M`, `N`, therefore, if `K` is in excess of `M`, `L` also is in excess of `N`, if it is equal, equal, and if less, less. [elem.5.def.5]
And `K`, `L` are equimultiples of `E`, `F`, and `M`, `N` other, chance, equimultiples of `G`, `H`; therefore, as `E` is to `G`, so is `F` to `H`. [elem.5.def.5]
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
