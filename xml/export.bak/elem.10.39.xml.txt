Proof:
For let two straight lines ,  incommensurable in square, and fulfilling the given conditions [elem.10.33
], be added together; I say that  is irrational.
For, since the rectangle ,  is medial, twice the rectangle ,  is also medial. [elem.10.6 elem.10.23.p.1]
But the sum of the squares on ,  is rational; therefore twice the rectangle ,  is incommensurable with the sum of the squares on , , so that the squares on ,  together with twice the rectangle ,  that is, the square on , is also incommensurable with the sum of the squares on , ; [elem.10.16
] therefore the square on  is irrational, so that  is also irrational. [elem.10.def.4
]
And let it be called . Q. E. D.
