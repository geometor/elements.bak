Proof:
For let the two straight lines ,  be at right angles to the plane of reference; I say that  is parallel to .
For let them meet the plane of reference at the points , , let the straight line  be joined, let  be drawn, in the plane of reference, at right angles to , let  be made equal to , and let , ,  be joined.
Now, since  is at right angles to the plane of reference, it will also make right angles with all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane of reference. [elem.11.def.3]
But each of the straight lines ,  is in the plane of reference and meets ; therefore each of the angles ,  is right.
For the same reason each of the angles ,  is also right.
And, since  is equal to , and  is common, the two sides ,  are equal to the two sides , ; and they include right angles; therefore the base  is equal to the base . [elem.1.4]
And, since  is equal to , while  is also equal to , the two sides ,  are equal to the two sides , ; and  is their common base; therefore the angle  is equal to the angle . [elem.1.8]
But the angle  is right; therefore the angle  is also right; therefore  is at right angles to .
But it is also at right angles to each of the straight lines , ; therefore  is set up at right angles to the three straight lines , ,  at their point of meeting; therefore the three straight lines , ,  are in one plane. [elem.11.5]
But, in whatever plane ,  are, in that plane is  also, for every triangle is in one plane; [elem.11.2] therefore the straight lines , ,  are in one plane.
And each of the angles ,  is right; therefore  is parallel to . [elem.1.28]
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
