To bisect a given finite straight line.

Proof:
Let `AB` be the given finite straight line.
Thus it is required to bisect the finite straight line `AB`.
Let the equilateral triangle `ABC` be constructed on it, [elem.1.1] and let the angle `ACB` be bisected by the straight line `CD`; [elem.1.9]
I say that the straight line `AB` has been bisected at the point `D`.
For, since `AC` is equal to `CB`, and `CD` is common, 
         and the angle `ACD` is equal to the angle `BCD`;
Therefore the given finite straight line `AB` has been bisected at `D`.
Enunciation:
To draw a straight line at right angles to a given straight line from a given point on it.

Proof:
Let `AB` be the given straight line, and `C` the given point on it.
Thus it is required to draw from the point `C` a straight line at right angles to the straight line `AB`.
Let a point `D` be taken at random on `AC`; let `CE` be made equal to `CD`; [elem.1.3] on `DE` let the equilateral triangle `FDE` be constructed, [elem.1.1] and let `FC` be joined;
I say that the straight line `FC` has been drawn at right angles to the given straight line `AB` from `C` the given point on it.
For, since `DC` is equal to `CE`, and `CF` is common,  and the base `DF` is equal to the base `FE`;  and they are adjacent angles.
But, when a straight line set up on a straight line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right; [elem.1.def.10]
Therefore the straight line `CF` has been drawn at right angles to the given straight line `AB` from the given point `C` on it.
Enunciation:
To a given infinite straight line, from a given point which is not on it, to draw a perpendicular straight line.

Proof:
Let `AB` be the given infinite straight line, and `C` the given point which is not on it; thus it is required to draw to the given infinite straight line `AB`, from the given point `C` which is not on it, a perpendicular straight line.
For let a point `D` be taken at random on the other side of the straight line `AB`, and with centre `C` and distance `CD` let the circle `EFG` be described; [elem.1.post.3]
I say that `CH` has been drawn perpendicular to the given infinite straight line `AB` from the given point `C` which is not on it.
For, since `GH` is equal to `HE`, and `HC` is common,  and the base `CG` is equal to the base `CE`;
But, when a straight line set up on a straight line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right, and the straight line standing on the other is called a perpendicular to that on which it stands. [elem.1.def.10]
Therefore `CH` has been drawn perpendicular to the given infinite straight line `AB` from the given point `C` which is not on it.
Enunciation:
If a straight line set up on a straight line make angles, it will make either two right angles or angles equal to two right angles.

Proof:
For let any straight line `AB` set up on the straight line `CD` make the angles `CBA`, `ABD`;
I say that the angles `CBA`, `ABD` are either two right angles or equal to two right angles.
Now, if the angle `CBA` is equal to the angle `ABD`,
But, if not, let `BE` be drawn from the point `B` at right angles to `CD`; [elem.1.11]
Then, since the angle `CBE` is equal to the two angles `CBA`, `ABE`,
Again, since the angle `DBA` is equal to the two angles `DBE`, `EBA`,
But the angles `CBE`, `EBD` were also proved equal to the same three angles; 
        But the angles `CBE`, `EBD` are two right angles;
Therefore etc.
Enunciation:
If with any straight line, and at a point on it, two straight lines not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles equal to two right angles, the two straight lines will be in a straight line with one another.

Proof:
For with any straight line `AB`, and at the point `B` on it, let the two straight lines `BC`, `BD` not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles `ABC`, `ABD` equal to two right angles;
I say that `BD` is in a straight line with `CB`.
For, if `BD` is not in a straight line with `BC`, let `BE` be in a straight line with `CB`.
Then, since the straight line `AB` stands on the straight line `CBE`, 
         But the angles `ABC`, `ABD` are also equal to two right angles;
Let the angle `CBA` be subtracted from each; therefore the remaining angle `ABE` is equal to the remaining angle `ABD`, [elem.1.c.n.3]
Similarly we can prove that neither is any other straight line except `BD`.
Therefore etc.
Enunciation:
If two straight lines cut one another, they make the vertical angles equal to one another.

Proof:
For let the straight lines `AB`, `CD` cut one another at the point `E`;
I say that the angle `AEC` is equal to the angle `DEB`,
For, since the straight line `AE` stands on the straight line `CD`, making the angles `CEA`, `AED`,
Again, since the straight line `DE` stands on the straight line `AB`, making the angles `AED`, `DEB`,
But the angles `CEA`, `AED` were also proved equal to two right angles;
Similarly it can be proved that the angles `CEB`, `DEA` are also equal.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.

In any triangle, if one of the sides be produced, the exterior angle is greater than either of the interior and opposite angles.

Proof:
Let `ABC` be a triangle, and let one side of it `BC` be produced to `D`;
I say that the exterior angle `ACD` is greater than either of the interior and opposite angles `CBA`, `BAC`.
Let `AC` be bisected at `E` [elem.1.10], and let `BE` be joined and produced in a straight line to `F`;
let `EF` be made equal to `BE`[elem.1.3], let `FC` be joined [elem.1.post.1], and let `AC` be drawn through to `G` [elem.1.post.2].
Then, since `AE` is equal to `EC`, and `BE` to `EF`,
But the angle `ECD` is greater than the angle `ECF`; [. 5]
Similarly also, if `BC` be bisected, the angle `BCG`, that is, the angle `ACD` [elem.1.15], can be proved greater than the angle `ABC` as well.
Therefore etc.
Enunciation:
In any triangle two angles taken together in any manner are less than two right angles.

Proof:
Let `ABC` be a triangle; I say that two angles of the triangle `ABC` taken together in any manner are less than two right angles.
For let `BC` be produced to `D`. [elem.1.post.2]
Then, since the angle `ACD` is an exterior angle of the triangle `ABC`,
it is greater than the interior and opposite angle `ABC`. [elem.1.16]  therefore the angles `ACD`, `ACB` are greater than the angles `ABC`, `BCA`.  But the angles `ACD`, `ACB` are equal to two right angles. [elem.1.13]
Therefore the angles `ABC`, `BCA` are less than two right angles.
Similarly we can prove that the angles `BAC`, `ACB` are also less than two right angles, and so are the angles `CAB`, `ABC` as well.
Therefore etc.
Enunciation:
In any triangle the greater side subtends the greater angle.

Proof:
For let `ABC` be a triangle having the side `AC` greater than `AB`;
I say that the angle `ABC` is also greater than the angle `BCA`.
For, since `AC` is greater than `AB`, let `AD` be made equal to `AB` [elem.1.3], and let `BD` bejoined.
Then, since the angle `ADB` is an exterior angle of the triangle `BCD`,
it is greater than the interior and opposite angle `DCB`. [elem.1.16]
But the angle `ADB` is equal to the angle `ABD`,
Therefore etc.
Enunciation:
In any triangle the greater angle is subtended by the greater side.

Proof:
Let `ABC` be a triangle having the angle `ABC` greater than the angle `BCA`;
I say that the side `AC` is also greater than the side `AB`.
For, if not, `AC` is either equal to `AB` or less.
Now `AC` is not equal to `AB`; for then the angle `ABC` would also have been equal to the angle `ACB`; [elem.1.5] but it is not;
Neither is `AC` less than `AB`, for then the angle `ABC` would also have been less than the angle `ACB`; [elem.1.18] but it is not;
And it was proved that it is not equal either.
Therefore etc.
Enunciation:
On a given finite straight line to construct an equilateral triangle.

Proof:
Let `AB` be the given finite straight line.
Thus it is required to construct an equilateral triangle on the straight line `AB`.
With centre `A` and distance `AB` let the circle `BCD` be described; [elem.1.post.3] again, with centre `B` and distance `BA` let the circle `ACE` be described; [elem.1.post.3] and from the point `C`, in which the circles cut one another, to the points `A`, `B` let the straight lines `CA`, `CB` be joined. [elem.1.post.1]
Now, since the point `A` is the centre of the circle `CDB`,
Again, since the point `B` is the centre of the circle `CAE`,
But `CA` was also proved equal to `AB`; therefore each of the straight lines `CA`, `CB` is equal to `AB`.
And things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another; [elem.1.c.n.1]
Therefore the three straight lines `CA`, `AB`, `BC` are equal to one another.
Therefore the triangle `ABC` is equilateral; and it has been constructed on the given finite straight line `AB`.
Enunciation:
In any triangle two sides taken together in any manner are greater than the remaining one.

Proof:
For let `ABC` be a triangle; I say that in the triangle `ABC` two sides taken together in any manner are greater than the remaining one, namely
For let `BA` be drawn through to the point `D`, let `DA` be made equal to `CA`, and let `DC` be joined.
Then, since `DA` is equal to `AC`, the angle `ADC` is also equal to the angle `ACD`; [elem.1.5]
And, since `DCB` is a triangle having the angle `BCD` greater than the angle `BDC`,
But `DA` is equal to `AC`;
Similarly we can prove that `AB`, `BC` are also greater than `CA`, and `BC`, `CA` than `AB`.
Therefore etc.
Enunciation:
If on one of the sides of a triangle, from its extremities, there be constructed two straight lines meeting within the triangle, the straight lines so constructed will be less than the remaining two sides of the triangle, but will contain a greater angle.

Proof:
On `BC`, one of the sides of the triangle `ABC`, from its extremities `B`, `C`, let the two straight lines `BD`, `DC` be constructed meeting within the triangle;
I say that `BD`, `DC` are less than the remaining two sides of the triangle `BA`, `AC`, but contain an angle `BDC` greater than the angle `BAC`.
For let `BD` be drawn through to `E`.
Then, since in any triangle two sides are greater than the remaining one, [elem.1.20]
Let `EC` be added to each;
Again, since, in the triangle `CED`,
But `BA`, `AC` were proved greater than `BE`, `EC`;
Again, since in any triangle the exterior angle is greater than the interior and opposite angle, [elem.1.16] therefore, in the triangle `CDE`,
For the same reason, moreover, in the triangle `ABE` also,  But the angle `BDC` was proved greater than the angle `CEB`;
Therefore etc.
Enunciation:
Out of three straight lines, which are equal to three given straight lines, to construct a triangle: thus it is necessary that two of the straight lines taken together in any manner should be greater than the remaining one. [elem.1.20]

Proof:
Let the three given straight lines be `A`, `B`, `C`, and of these let two taken together in any manner be greater than the remaining one, namely `A`, `B` greater than `C`,  and `B`, `C` greater than `A`; thus it is required to construct a triangle out of straight lines equal to `A`, `B`, `C`.
Let there be set out a straight line `DE`, terminated at `D` but of infinite length in the direction of `E`, and let `DF` be made equal to `A`, `FG` equal to `B`, and `GH` equal to `C`. [elem.1.3]
With centre `F` and distance `FD` let the circle `DKL` be described; again, with centre `G` and distance `GH` let the circle `KLH` be described; and let `KF`, `KG` be joined;
I say that the triangle `KFG` has been constructed out of three straight lines equal to `A`, `B`, `C`.
For, since the point `F` is the centre of the circle `DKL`,
But `FD` is equal to `A`;
Again, since the point `G` is the centre of the circle `LKH`,
But `GH` is equal to `C`;  therefore the three straight lines `KF`, `FG`, `GK` are equal to the three straight lines `A`, `B`, `C`.
Therefore out of the three straight lines `KF`, `FG`, `GK`, which are equal to the three given straight lines `A`, `B`, `C`, the triangle `KFG` has been constructed.
Enunciation:
On a given straight line and at a point on it to construct a rectilineal angle equal to a given rectilineal angle.

Proof:
Let `AB` be the given straight line, `A` the point on it, and the angle `DCE` the given rectilineal angle;
thus it is required to construct on the given straight line `AB`, and at the point `A` on it, a rectilineal angle equal to the given rectilineal angle `DCE`.
On the straight lines `CD`, `CE` respectively let the points `D`, `E` be taken at random; let `DE` be joined, and out of three straight lines which are equal to the three straight lines `CD`, `DE`, `CE` let the triangle `AFG` be constructed in such a way that `CD` is equal to `AF`, `CE` to `AG`, and further `DE` to `FG`.
Then, since the two sides `DC`, `CE` are equal to the two sides `FA`, `AG` respectively,
Therefore on the given straight line `AB`, and at the point `A` on it, the rectilineal angle `FAG` has been constructed equal to the given rectilineal angle `DCE`.
Enunciation:
If two triangles have the two sides equal to two sides respectively, but have the one of the angles contained by the equal straight lines greater than the other, they will also have the base greater than the base.

Proof:
Let `ABC`, `DEF` be two triangles having the two sides `AB`, `AC` equal to the two sides `DE`, `DF` respectively, namely `AB` to `DE`, and `AC` to `DF`, and let the angle at `A` be greater than the angle at `D`;
I say that the base `BC` is also greater than the base `EF`.
For, since the angle `BAC` is greater than the angle `EDF`, let there be constructed, on the straight line `DE`, and at the point `D` on it, the angle `EDG`
        equal to the angle `BAC`; [elem.1.23] let `DG` be made equal to either of the two straight lines `AC`, `DF`, and let `EG`, `FG` be joined.
Then, since `AB` is equal to `DE`, and `AC` to `DG`, the two sides `BA`, `AC` are equal to the two sides `ED`, `DG`, respectively;
Again, since `DF` is equal to `DG`,
Therefore the angle `EFG` is much greater than the angle `EGF`.
And, since `EFG` is a triangle having the angle `EFG`
        greater than the angle `EGF`,
But `EG` is equal to `BC`.
Therefore etc.
Enunciation:
If two triangles have the two sides equal to two sides respectively, but have the base greater than the base, they will also have the one of the angles contained by the equal straight lines greater than the other.

Let `ABC`, `DEF` be two triangles having the two sides `AB`, `AC` equal to the two sides `DE`, `DF` respectively, namely `AB` to `DE`, and `AC` to `DF`; and let the base `BC` be greater than the base `EF`;
I say that the angle `BAC` is also greater than the angle `EDF`.
For, if not, it is either equal to it or less.
Now the angle `BAC` is not equal to the angle `EDF`; for then the base `BC` would also have been equal to the base `EF`, [elem.1.4]
Neither again is the angle `BAC` less than the angle `EDF`; for then the base `BC` would also have been less than the base `EF`, [elem.1.24]
But it was proved that it is not equal either;
Therefore etc.
Enunciation:
If two triangles have the two angles equal to two angles respectively, and one side equal to one side, namely, either the side adjoining the equal angles, or that subtending one of the equal angles, they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides and the remaining angle to the remaining angle.

Proof:
Let `ABC`, `DEF` be two triangles having the two angles `ABC`, `BCA` equal to the two angles `DEF`, `EFD` respectively, namely the angle `ABC` to the angle `DEF`, and the angle `BCA` to the angle `EFD`; and let them also have one side equal to one side, first that adjoining the equal angles, namely `BC` to `EF`;
I say that they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides respectively, namely `AB` to `DE` and `AC` to `DF`, and the remaining angle to the remaining angle, namely the angle `BAC` to the angle `EDF`.
For, if `AB` is unequal to `DE`, one of them is greater.
Let `AB` be greater, and let `BG` be made equal to `DE`; and let `GC` be joined.
Then, since `BG` is equal to `DE`, and `BC` to `EF`, the two sides `GB`, `BC` are equal to the two sides `DE`, `EF` respectively; and the angle `GBC` is equal to the angle `DEF`;  But the angle `DFE` is by hypothesis equal to the angle `BCA`;
But `BC` is also equal to `EF`;
Again, let sides subtending equal angles be equal, as `AB` to `DE`;
I say again that the remaining sides will be equal to the remaining sides, namely `AC` to `DF` and `BC` to `EF`, and further the remaining angle `BAC` is equal to the remaining angle `EDF`.
For, if `BC` is unequal to `EF`, one of them is greater.
Let `BC` be greater, if possible, and let `BH` be made equal to `EF`; let `AH` be joined.
Then, since `BH` is equal to `EF`, and `AB` to `DE`, the two sides `AB`, `BH` are equal to the two sides `DE`, `EF` respectively, and they contain equal angles;  and the triangle `ABH` is equal to the triangle `DEF`, and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles, namely those which the equal sides subtend; [elem.1.4]
But the angle `EFD` is equal to the angle `BCA`; therefore, in the triangle `AHC`, the exterior angle `BHA` is equal to the interior and opposite angle `BCA`:
Therefore `BC` is not unequal to `EF`,
But `AB` is also equal to `DE`; therefore the two sides `AB`, `BC` are equal to the two sides `DE`, `EF` respectively, and they contain equal angles;  and the remaining angle `BAC` equal to the remaining angle `EDF`. [elem.1.4]
Therefore etc.

If a straight line falling on two straight lines make the alternate angles equal to one another, the straight lines will be parallel to one another.

Proof:
For let the straight line `EF` falling on the two straight lines `AB`, `CD` make the alternate angles `AEF`, `EFD` equal to one another;
I say that `AB` is parallel to `CD`.
For, if not, `AB`, `CD` when produced will meet either in the direction of `B`, `D` or towards `A`, `C`.
Let them be produced and meet, in the direction of `B`, `D`, at `G`.
Then, in the triangle `GEF`, the exterior angle `AEF` is equal to the interior and opposite angle `EFG`: which is impossible. [elem.1.16]
Therefore `AB`, `CD` when produced will not meet in the direction of `B`, `D`.
Similarly it can be proved that neither will they meet towards `A`, `C`.
But straight lines which do not meet in either direction are parallel; [elem.1.def.23]

If a straight line falling on two straight lines make the exterior angle equal to the interior and opposite angle on the same side, or the interior angles on the same side equal to two right angles, the straight lines will be parallel to one another.

I say that `AB` is parallel to `CD`.
For, since the angle `EGB` is equal to the angle `GHD`, while the angle `EGB` is equal to the angle `AGH`, [elem.1.15]  the angle `AGH` is also equal to the angle `GHD`; and they are alternate;
Again, since the angles `BGH`, `GHD` are equal to two right angles, and the angles `AGH`, `BGH` are also equal to two right angles, [elem.1.13] the angles `AGH`, `BGH` are equal to the angles `BGH`, `GHD`.

I say that it makes the alternate angles `AGH`, `GHD` equal, the exterior angle `EGB` equal to the interior and opposite angle `GHD`, and the interior angles on the same side, namely `BGH`, `GHD`, equal to two right angles.
For, if the angle `AGH` is unequal to the angle `GHD`, one of them is greater.
Let the angle `AGH` be greater.
Let the angle `BGH` be added to each; therefore the angles `AGH`, `BGH` are greater than the angles `BGH`, `GHD`.
But the angles `AGH`, `BGH` are equal to two right angles; [elem.1.13]
But straight lines produced indefinitely from angles less than two right angles meet; [elem.1.post.5]

And in these `DA` is equal to `DB`;
But `BC` was also proved equal to `BG`;

Then, since the straight line `GK` has fallen on the parallel straight lines `AB`, `EF`,
Again, since the straight line `GK` has fallen on the parallel straight lines `EF`, `CD`,
But the angle `AGK` was also proved equal to the angle `GHF`;  and they are alternate.
Therefore `AB` is parallel to `CD`.

Then, since the straight line `AD` falling on the two straight lines `BC`, `EF` has made the alternate angles `EAD`, `ADC` equal to one another,

Let `BC` be joined.
Then, since `AB` is parallel to `CD`,  and `BC` has fallen upon them,

In parallelogrammic areas the opposite sides and angles are equal to one another, and the diameter bisects the areas.

Proof:
Let `ACDB` be a parallelogrammic area, and `BC` its diameter; I say that the opposite sides and angles of the parallelogram `ACDB` are equal to one another, and the diameter `BC` bisects it.
For, since `AB` is parallel to `CD`, and the straight line `BC` has fallen  upon them,
Again, since `AC` is parallel to `BD`, and `BC`has fallen upon them,
Therefore `ABC`, `DCB` are two triangles having the two angles `ABC`, `BCA` equal to the two angles `DCB`, `CBD` respectively, and one side equal to one side, namely that adjoining the equal angles and common to both of them, `BC`;  and further the angle `BAC` is equal to the angle `CDB`.
And, since the angle `ABC` is equal to the angle `BCD`, 
        And the angle `BAC` was also proved equal to the angle `CDB`.
Therefore in parallelogrammic areas the opposite sides and angles are equal to one another.
I say, next, that the diameter also bisects the areas.
For, since `AB` is equal to `CD`, and `BC` is common, the two sides `AB`, `BC` are equal to the two sides `DC`, `CB` respectively;
Therefore the diameter `BC` bisects the parallelogram `ACDB`.

For let `BE`, `CH` be joined.
Then, since `BC` is equal to `FG` while `FG` is equal to `EH`,
But they are also parallel.

I say that the complement `BK` is equal to the complement `KD`.
For, since `ABCD` is a parallelogram, and `AC` its diameter,
Again, since `EH` is a parallelogram, and `AK` is its diameter,

Let `HB` be joined.
Then, since the straight line `HF` falls upon the parallels `AH`, `EF`,  Therefore the angles `BHG`, `GFE` are less than two right angles; and straight lines produced indefinitely from angles less than two right angles meet; [elem.1.post.5]
Let them be produced and meet at `K`; through the point `K` let `KL` be drawn parallel to either `EA` or `FH`, [elem.1.31] and let `HA`, `GB` be produced to the points `L`, `M`.

Let `DB` be joined, and let the parallelogram `FH` be constructed equal to the triangle `ABD`, in the angle `HKF` which is equal to `E`; [elem.1.42] let the parallelogram `GM` equal to the triangle `DBC` be applied to the straight line `GH`, in the angle `GHM` which is equal to `E`. [elem.1.44]
Then, since the angle `E` is equal to each of the angles `HKF`, `GHM`,
Let the angle `KHG` be added to each; therefore the angles `FKH`, `KHG` are equal to the angles `KHG`, `GHM`.
But the angles `FKH`, `KHG` are equal to two right angles; [elem.1.29] therefore the angles `KHG`, `GHM` are also equal to two right angles.
Thus, with a straight line `GH`, and at the point `H` on it, two straight lines `KH`, `HM` not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles equal to two right angles;
And, since the straight line `HG` falls upon the parallels `KM`, `FG`, the alternate angles `MHG`, `HGF` are equal to one another. [elem.1.29]
Let the angle `HGL` be added to each; therefore the angles `MHG`, `HGL` are equal to the angles `HGF`, `HGL`. [elem.1.c.n.2]
But the angles `MHG`, `HGL` are equal to two right angles; [elem.1.29] therefore the angles `HGF`, `HGL` are also equal to two right angles. [elem.1.c.n.1]
And, since `FK` is equal and parallel to `HG`, [elem.1.34] 
        `KF` is also equal and parallel to `ML`; [elem.1.c.n.1;elem.1.30] and the straight lines `KM`, `FL` join them (at their extremities); therefore `KM`, `FL` are also equal and parallel. [elem.1.33]

Therefore `ADEB` is a parallelogram;
But `AB` is equal to `AD`;  therefore the parallelogram `ADEB` is equilateral.
I say next that it is also right-angled.
For, since the straight line `AD` falls upon the parallels `AB`, `DE`,
But the angle `BAD` is right;
And in parallelogrammic areas the opposite sides and angles are equal to one another; [elem.1.34]
And it was also proved equilateral.

In right-angled triangles the square on the side subtending the right angle is equal to the squares on the sides containing the right angle.

For let there be described on `BC` the square `BDEC`, and on `BA`, `AC` the squares `GB`, `HC`; [elem.1.46] through `A` let `AL` be drawn parallel to either `BD` or `CE`, and let `AD`, `FC` be joined.
Then, since each of the angles `BAC`, `BAG` is right, it follows that with a straight line `BA`, and at the point `A` on it, the two straight lines `AC`, `AG` not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles equal to two right angles;
For the same reason
And, since the angle `DBC` is equal to the angle `FBA`: for each is right: let the angle `ABC` be added to each;
And, since `DB` is equal to `BC`, and `FB` to `BA`, the two sides `AB`, `BD` are equal to the two sides `FB`, `BC` respectively,
Now the parallelogram `BL` is double of the triangle `ABD`, for they have the same base `BD` and are in the same parallels `BD`, `AL`. [elem.1.41]
And the square `GB` is double of the triangle `FBC`, for they again have the same base `FB` and are in the same parallels `FB`, `GC`. [elem.1.41]
[But the doubles of equals are equal to one another.]
Similarly, if `AE`, `BK` be joined, the parallelogram `CL` can also be proved equal to the square `HC`;

If in a triangle the square on one of the sides be equal to the squares on the remaining two sides of the triangle, the angle contained by the remaining two sides of the triangle is right.

I say that the angle `BAC` is right.
For let `AD` be drawn from the point `A` at right angles to the straight line `AC`, let `AD` be made equal to `BA`, and let `DC` be joined.
Since `DA` is equal to `AB`, the square on `DA` is also equal to the square on `AB`.
Let the square on `AC` be added to each;
But the square on `DC` is equal to the squares on `DA`, `AC`, for the angle `DAC` is right; [elem.1.47] and the square on `BC` is equal to the squares on `BA`, `AC`, for this is the hypothesis;
And, since `DA` is equal to `AB`, and `AC` is common,  and the base `DC` is equal to the base `BC`;  But the angle `DAC` is right;

If two triangles have the two sides equal to two sides respectively, and have the angles contained by the equal straight lines equal, they will also have the base equal to the base, the triangle will be equal to the triangle, and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles respectively, namely those which the equal sides subtend.

Proof:
Let `ABC`, `DEF` be two triangles having the two sides `AB`, `AC` equal to the two sides `DE`, `DF` respectively, namely `AB` to `DE` and `AC` to `DF`, and the angle `BAC` equal to the angle `EDF`.
I say that the base `BC` is also equal to the base `EF`, the triangle `ABC` will be equal to the triangle `DEF`, and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles respectively, namely those which the equal sides subtend, that is, the angle `ABC` to the angle `DEF`, and the angle `ACB` to the angle `DFE`.
For, if the triangle `ABC` be applied to the triangle `DEF`,  then the point `B` will also coincide with `E`, because `AB` is equal to `DE`.
Again, `AB` coinciding with `DE`, the straight line `AC` will also coincide with `DF`, because the angle `BAC` is equal to the angle `EDF`;
But `B` also coincided with `E`; hence the base `BC` will coincide with the base `EF`.
[For if, when `B` coincides with `E` and `C` with `F`, the base `BC` does not coincide with the base `EF`, two straight lines will enclose a space: which is impossible.
Thus the whole triangle `ABC` will coincide with the whole triangle `DEF`,
And the remaining angles will also coincide with the remaining angles and will be equal to them, the angle `ABC` to the angle `DEF`, and the angle `ACB` to the angle `DFE`.
Therefore etc.

In isosceles triangles the angles at the base are equal to one another, and, if the equal straight lines be produced further, the angles under the base will be equal to one another.

Then, since `AF` is equal to `AG` and `AB` to `AC`,  and they contain a common angle, the angle `FAG`.  and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles respectively, namely those which the equal sides subtend,
And, since the whole `AF` is equal to the whole `AG`,
But `FC` was also proved equal to `GB`; therefore the two sides `BF`, `FC` are equal to the two sides `CG`, `GB` respectively; and the angle `BFC` is equal to the angle `CGB`,  therefore the triangle `BFC` is also equal to the triangle `CGB`, and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles respectively, namely those which the equal sides subtend;
Accordingly, since the whole angle `ABG` was proved equal to the angle `ACF`,  the remaining angle `ABC` is equal to the remaining angle `ACB`;  But the angle `FBC` was also proved equal to the angle `GCB`;

For, if `AB` is unequal to `AC`, one of them is greater.
Let `AB` be greater; and from `AB` the greater let `DB` be cut off equal to `AC` the less;

Then, since `AC` is equal to `AD`,  therefore the angle `CDB` is much greater than the angle `DCB`.

        for, if the base `BC` coincides with the base `EF`, and the sides `BA`, `AC` do not coincide with `ED`, `DF` but fall beside them as `EG`, `GF`,
Therefore it is not possible that, if the base `BC` be applied to the base `EF`, the sides `BA`, `AC` should not coincide with `ED`, `DF`; 
        so that the angle `BAC` will also coincide with the angle `EDF`, and will be equal to it.
