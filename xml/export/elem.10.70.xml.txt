Enunciation:
> A straight line commensurable with the side of the sum of two medial areas is the side of the sum of two medial areas.

Proof:
Let > AB be the side of the sum of two medial areas, and > CD commensurable with > AB; it is to be proved that > CD is also the side of the sum of two medial areas.
For, since > AB is the side of the sum of two medial areas,  let it be divided into its straight lines at > E; therefore > AE, > EB are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them medial, the rectangle contained by them medial, and furthermore the sum of the squares on > AE, > EB incommensurable with the rectangle > AE, > EB. [elem.10.41]
Let the same construction be made as before.
We can then prove similarly that > CF, > FD are also incommensurable in square, the sum of the squares on > AE, > EB is commensurable with the sum of the squares on > CF, > FD, and the rectangle > AE, > EB with the rectangle > CF, > FD; so that the sum of the squares on > CF, > FD is also medial, the rectangle > CF, > FD is medial, and moreover the sum of the squares on > CF, > FD is incommensurable with the rectangle > CF, > FD.
Therefore > CD is the side of the sum of two medial areas. Q. E. D.
