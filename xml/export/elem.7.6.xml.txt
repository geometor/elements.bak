Enunciation:
> If a number be parts of a number, and another be the same parts of another, the sum will also be the same parts of the sum that the one is of the one.

Proof:
For let the number > AB be parts of the number > C, and another, > DE, the same parts of another, > F, that > AB is of > C; I say that the sum of > AB, > DE is also the same parts of the sum of > C, > F that > AB is of > C.
For since, whatever parts > AB is of > C, > DE is also the same parts of > F, therefore, as many parts of > C as there are in > AB, so many parts of > F are there also in > DE.
Let > AB be divided into the parts of > C, namely > AG, > GB, and > DE into the parts of > F, namely > DH, > HE; thus the multitude of > AG, > GB will be equal to the multitude of > DH, > HE.
And since, whatever part > AG is of > C, the same part is > DH of > F also, therefore, whatever part > AG is of > C, the same part also is the sum of > AG, > DH of the sum of > C, > F. [elem.7.5]
For the same reason, whatever part > GB is of > C, the same part also is the sum of > GB, > HE of the sum of > C, > F.
Therefore, whatever parts > AB is of > C, the same parts also is the sum of > AB, > DE of the sum of > C, > F. Q. E. D.
