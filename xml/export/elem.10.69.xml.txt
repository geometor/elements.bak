Enunciation:
> A straight line commensurable with the side of a rational plus a medial area is itself also the side of a rational plus a medial area.

Proof:
Let > AB be the side of a rational plus a medial area, and let > CD be commensurable with > AB; it is to be proved that > CD is also the side of a rational plus a medial area.
Let > AB be divided into its straight lines at > E; therefore > AE, > EB are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them medial, but the rectangle contained by them rational. [elem.10.40]
Let the same construction be made as before.
We can then prove similarly that > CF, > FD are incommensurable in square, and the sum of the squares on > AE, > EB is commensurable with the sum of the squares on > CF, > FD, and the rectangle > AE, > EB with the rectangle > CF, > FD; so that the sum of the squares on > CF, > FD is also medial, and the rectangle > CF, > FD rational.
Therefore > CD is the side of a rational plus a medial area. Q. E. D.
