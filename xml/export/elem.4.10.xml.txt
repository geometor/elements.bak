`To construct an isosceles triangle having each of the angles at the base double of the remaining one`.

Proof:
Let any straight line `AB` be set out, and let it be cut at the point `C` so that the rectangle contained by `AB`, `BC` is equal to the square on `CA`; [elem.2.11] with centre `A` and distance `AB` let the circle `BDE` be described, and let there be fitted in the circle `BDE` the straight line `BD` equal to the straight line `AC` which is not greater than the diameter of the circle `BDE`. [elem.4.1]
Let `AD`, `DC` be joined, and let the circle `ACD` be circumscribed about the triangle `ACD`. [elem.4.5]
Then, since the rectangle `AB`, `BC` is equal to the square on `AC`, and `AC` is equal to `BD`, therefore the rectangle `AB`, `BC` is equal to the square on `BD`.
And, since a point `B` has been taken outside the circle `ACD`, and from `B` the two straight lines `BA`, `BD` have fallen on the circle `ACD`, and one of them cuts it, while the other falls on it, and the rectangle `AB`, `BC` is equal to the square on `BD`, > therefore `BD` touches the circle `ACD`. [elem.3.37]
Since, then, `BD` touches it, and `DC` is drawn across from the point of contact at `D`, therefore the angle `BDC` is equal to the angle `DAC` in the alternate segment of the circle. [elem.3.32]
Since, then, the angle `BDC` is equal to the angle `DAC`, let the angle `CDA` be added to each; therefore the whole angle `BDA` is equal to the two angles `CDA`, `DAC`.
But the exterior angle `BCD` is equal to the angles `CDA`, `DAC`; [elem.1.32] therefore the angle `BDA` is also equal to the angle `BCD`.
But the angle `BDA` is equal to the angle `CBD`, since the side `AD` is also equal to `AB`; [elem.1.5] so that the angle `DBA` is also equal to the angle `BCD`.
Therefore the three angles `BDA`, `DBA`, `BCD` are equal to one another.
And, since the angle `DBC` is equal to the angle `BCD`, > the side `BD` is also equal to the side `DC`. [elem.1.6]
But `BD` is by hypothesis equal to `CA`; therefore `CA` is also equal to `CD`, > so that the angle `CDA` is also equal to the angle `DAC`; [elem.1.5] therefore the angles `CDA`, `DAC` are double of the angle `DAC`.
But the angle `BCD` is equal to the angles `CDA`, `DAC`; therefore the angle `BCD` is also double of the angle `CAD`.
But the angle `BCD` is equal to each of the angles `BDA`, `DBA`; therefore each of the angles `BDA`, `DBA` is also double of the angle `DAB`.
Therefore the isosceles triangle `ABD` has been constructed having each of the angles at the base `DB` double of the remaining one. Q. E. F.
