> Given two numbers, to investigate whether it is possible to find a third proportional to them.

Proof:
Let > A, > B be the given two numbers, and let it be required to investigate whether it is possible to find a third proportional to them.
Now > A, > B are either prime to one another or not.
And, if they are prime to one another, it has been proved that it is impossible to find a third proportional to them. [elem.9.16]
Next, let > A, > B not be prime to one another, and let > B by multiplying itself make > C.
Then > A either measures > C or does not measure it.
First, let it measure it according to > D; therefore > A by multiplying > D has made > C.
But, further, > B has also by multiplying itself made > C; therefore the product of > A, > D is equal to the square on > B.
Therefore, as > A is to > B, so is > B to > D; [elem.7.19] therefore a third proportional number > D has been found to > A, > B.
Next, let > A not measure > C; I say that it is impossible to find a third proportional number to > A, > B.
For, if possible, let > D, such third proportional, have been found.
Therefore the product of > A, > D is equal to the square on > B.
But the square on > B is > C; therefore the product of > A, > D is equal to > C.
Hence > A by multiplying > D has made > C; therefore > A measures > C according to > D.
But, by hypothesis, it also does not measure it: which is absurd.
Therefore it is not possible to find a third proportional number to > A, > B when > A does not measure > C. Q. E. D.
