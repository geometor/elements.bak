> If two numbers have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number, and the first be square, the second will also be square.

Proof:
For let the two numbers > A, > B have to one another the ratio which the square number > C has to the square number > D, and let > A be square; I say that > B is also square.
For, since > C, > D are square, > C, > D are similar plane numbers.
Therefore one mean proportional number falls between > C, > D. [elem.8.18]
And, as > C is to > D, so is > A to > B; therefore one mean proportional number falls between > A, > B also. [elem.8.8]
And > A is square; therefore > B is also square. [elem.8.22] Q. E. D.
