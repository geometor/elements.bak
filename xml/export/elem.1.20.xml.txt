Enunciation:
In any triangle two sides taken together in any manner are greater than the remaining one.

Proof:
For let `ABC` be a triangle; I say that in the triangle `ABC` two sides taken together in any manner are greater than the remaining one, namely
For let `BA` be drawn through to the point `D`, let `DA` be made equal to `CA`, and let `DC` be joined.
Then, since `DA` is equal to `AC`, the angle `ADC` is also equal to the angle `ACD`; [elem.1.5]
And, since `DCB` is a triangle having the angle `BCD` greater than the angle `BDC`,
But `DA` is equal to `AC`;
Similarly we can prove that `AB`, `BC` are also greater than `CA`, and `BC`, `CA` than `AB`.
Therefore etc.
