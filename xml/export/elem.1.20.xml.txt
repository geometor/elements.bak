Enunciation:
In any triangle two sides taken together in any manner are greater than the remaining one.

Proof:
For let `ABC` be a triangle; I say that in the triangle `ABC` two sides taken together in any manner are greater than the remaining one, namely > `BA`, `AC` greater than `BC`, `AB`, `BC` greater than `AC`, `BC`, `CA` greater than `AB`.
For let `BA` be drawn through to the point `D`, let `DA` be made equal to `CA`, and let `DC` be joined.
Then, since `DA` is equal to `AC`, the angle `ADC` is also equal to the angle `ACD`; [elem.1.5] 
        > therefore the angle `BCD` is greater than the angle `ADC`. [elem.1.c.n.5]
And, since `DCB` is a triangle having the angle `BCD` greater than the angle `BDC`, > and the greater angle is subtended by the greater side, [elem.1.19] therefore `DB` is greater than `BC`.
But `DA` is equal to `AC`; > therefore `BA`, `AC` are greater than `BC`.
Similarly we can prove that `AB`, `BC` are also greater than `CA`, and `BC`, `CA` than `AB`.
Therefore etc.
