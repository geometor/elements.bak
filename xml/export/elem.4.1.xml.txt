Enunciation:
`Into a given circle to fit a straight line equal to a given straight line which is not greater than the diameter of the circle`.

Proof:
Let `ABC` be the given circle, and `D` the given straight line not greater than the diameter of the circle; thus it is required to fit into the circle `ABC` a straight line equal to the straight line `D`.
Let a diameter `BC` of the circle `ABC` be drawn.
Then, if `BC` is equal to `D`, that which was enjoined will have been done; for `BC` has been fitted into the circle `ABC` equal to the straight line `D`.
But, if `BC` is greater than `D`, let `CE` be made equal to `D`, and with centre `C` and distance `CE` let the circle `EAF` be described; let `CA` be joined.
Then, since the point `C` is the centre of the circle `EAF`, > `CA` is equal to `CE`.
But `CE` is equal to `D`; > therefore `D` is also equal to `CA`.
Therefore into the given circle `ABC` there has been fitted `CA` equal to the given straight line `D`.
