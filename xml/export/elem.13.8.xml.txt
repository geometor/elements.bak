Proof:
For in the equilateral and equiangular pentagon > ABCDE let the straight lines > AC, > BE, cutting one another at the point > H, subtend two angles taken in order, the angles at > A, > B; I say that each of them has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at the point > H, and their greater segments are equal to the side of the pentagon.
For let the circle > ABCDE be circumscribed about the pentagon > ABCDE. [elem.4.14]
Then, since the two straight lines > EA, > AB are equal to the two > AB, > BC, and they contain equal angles, therefore the base > BE is equal to the base > AC, the triangle > ABE is equal to the triangle > ABC, and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles respectively, namely those which the equal sides subtend. [elem.1.4]
Therefore the angle > BAC is equal to the angle > ABE; therefore the angle > AHE is double of the angle > BAH. [elem.1.32]
But the angle > EAC is also double of the angle > BAC, inasmuch as the circumference > EDC is also double of the circumference > CB; [elem.3.28, elem.6.33] therefore the angle > HAE is equal to the angle > AHE; hence the straight line > HE is also equal to > EA, that is, to > AB. [elem.1.6]
And, since the straight line > BA is equal to > AE, the angle > ABE is also equal to the angle > AEB. [elem.1.5]
But the angle > ABE was proved equal to the angle > BAH; therefore the angle > BEA is also equal to the angle > BAH.
And the angle > ABE is common to the two triangles > ABE and > ABH; therefore the remaining angle > BAE is equal to the remaining angle > AHB; [elem.1.32] therefore the triangle > ABE is equiangular with the triangle > ABH; therefore, proportionally, as > EB is to > BA, so is > AB to > BH. [elem.6.4]
But > BA is equal to > EH; therefore, as > BE is to > EH, so is > EH to > HB.
And > BE is greater than > EH; therefore > EH is also greater than > HB. [elem.5.14]
Therefore > BE has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at > H, and the greater segment > HE is equal to the side of the pentagon.
Similarly we can prove that > AC has also been cut in extreme and mean ratio at > H, and its greater segment > CH is equal to the side of the pentagon. Q. E. D.
