Enunciation:
> A straight line commensurable with an apotome of a medial straight line is an apotome of a medial straight line and the same in order.

Proof:
Let > AB be an apotome of a medial straight line, and let > CD be commensurable in length with > AB; I say that > CD is also an apotome of a medial straight line and the same in order with > AB.
For, since > AB is an apotome of a medial straight line, let > EB be the annex to it.
Therefore > AE, > EB are medial straight lines commensurable in square only. [elem.10.74 elem.10.75]
Let it be contrived that, as > AB is to > CD, so is > BE to > DF; [elem.6.12] therefore > AE is also commensurable with > CF, and > BE with > DF. [elem.5.12, elem.10.11]
But > AE, > EB are medial straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore > CF, > FD are also medial straight lines [elem.10.23] commensurable in square only; [elem.10.13] therefore > CD is an apotome of a medial straight line. [elem.10.74 elem.10.75]
I say next that it is also the same in order with > AB.
Since, as > AE is to > EB, so is > CF to > FD, therefore also, as the square on > AE is to the rectangle > AE, > EB, so is the square on > CF to the rectangle > CF, > FD.
But the square on > AE is commensurable with the square on > CF; therefore the rectangle > AE, > EB is also commensurable with the rectangle > CF, > FD. [elem.5.16, elem.10.11]
Therefore, if the rectangle > AE, > EB is rational, the rectangle > CF, > FD will also be rational, [elem.10.def.4] and if the rectangle > AE, > EB is medial, the rectangle > CF, > FD is also medial. [elem.10.23.p.1]
Therefore > CD is an apotome of a medial straight line and the same in order with > AB. [elem.10.74 elem.10.75] Q. E. D.
