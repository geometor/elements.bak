Enunciation:
`If from a parallelogram there be taken away a parallelogram similar and similarly situated to the whole and having a common angle with it`, `it is about the same diameter with the whole`

Proof:
For from the parallelogram `ABCD` let there be taken away the parallelogram `AF` similar and similarly situated to `ABCD`, and having the angle `DAB` common with it;  I say that `ABCD` is about the same diameter with `AF`.
For suppose it is not, but, if possible, let `AHC` be the diameter < of `ABCD` >, let `GF` be produced and carried through to `H`, and let `HK` be drawn through `H` parallel to either of the straight lines `AD`, `BC`. [elem.1.31]
Since, then, `ABCD` is about the same diameter with `KG`, therefore, as `DA` is to `AB`, so is `GA` to `AK`. [elem.6.24]
But also, because of the similarity of `ABCD`, `EG`, > as `DA` is to `AB`, so is `GA` to `AE`; therefore also, as `GA` is to `AK`, so is `GA` to `AE`. [elem.5.11]
Therefore `GA` has the same ratio to each of the straight lines `AK`, `AE`.
Therefore `AE` is equal to `AK` [elem.5.9], the less to the greater : which is impossible.
Therefore `ABCD` cannot but be about the same diameter with `AF`; therefore the parallelogram `ABCD` is about the same diameter with the parallelogram `AF`.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
