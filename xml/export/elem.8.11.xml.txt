> Between two square numbers there is one mean proportional number, and the square has to the square the ratio duplicate of that which the side has to the side.

Proof:
Let > A, > B be square numbers, and let > C be the side of > A, and > D of > B; I say that between > A, > B there is one mean proportional number, and > A has to > B the ratio duplicate of that which > C has to > D.
For let > C by multiplying > D make > E.
Now, since > A is a square and > C is its side, therefore > C by multiplying itself has made > A.
For the same reason also > D by multiplying itself has made > B.
Since then > C by multiplying the numbers > C, > D has made > A, > E respectively, therefore, as > C is to > D, so is > A to > E. [elem.7.17]
For the same reason also, > as > C is to > D, so is > E to > B. [elem.7.18]
Therefore also, as > A is to > E, so is > E to > B.
Therefore between > A, > B there is one mean proportional number.
I say next that > A also has to > B the ratio duplicate of that which > C has to > D.
For, since > A, > E, > B are three numbers in proportion, therefore > A has to > B the ratio duplicate of that which > A has to > E. [elem.5.def.9]
But, as > A is to > E, so is > C to > D.
Therefore > A has to > B the ratio duplicate of that which the side > C has to > D. Q. E. D.
