`About a given circle to circumscribe an equilateral and equiangular pentagon`.

Proof:
Let `ABCDE` be the given circle; thus it is required to circumscribe an equilateral and equiangular pentagon about the circle `ABCDE`.
Let `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E` be conceived to be the angular points of the inscribed pentagon, so that the circumferences `AB`, `BC`, `CD`, `DE`, `EA` are equal; [elem.4.11]  through `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `E` let `GH`, `HK`, `KL`, `LM`, `MG` be drawn touching the circle; [elem.3.16.p.1] let the centre `F` of the circle `ABCDE` be taken [elem.3.1], and let `FB`, `FK`, `FC`, `FL`, `FD` be joined.
Then, since the straight line `KL` touches the circle `ABCDE` at `C`, and `FC` has been joined from the centre `F` to the point of contact at `C`, > therefore `FC` is perpendicular to `KL`; [elem.3.18] therefore each of the angles at `C` is right.
For the same reason > the angles at the points `B`, `D` are also right.
And, since the angle `FCK` is right, therefore the square on `FK` is equal to the squares on `FC`, `CK`.
For the same reason [elem.1.47] > the square on `FK` is also equal to the squares on `FB`, `BK`; so that the squares on `FC`, `CK` are equal to the squares on `FB`, `BK`, of which the square on `FC` is equal to the square on `FB`; therefore the square on `CK` which remains is equal to the square on `BK`.
Therefore `BK` is equal to `CK`.
And, since `FB` is equal to `FC`, and `FK` common, > the two sides `BF`, `FK` are equal to the two sides `CF`, `FK`; and the base `BK` equal to the base `CK`; therefore the angle `BFK` is equal to the angle `KFC`, [elem.1.8] and the angle `BKF` to the angle `FKC`. Therefore the angle `BFC` is double of the angle `KFC`, > and the angle `BKC` of the angle `FKC`.
For the same reason > the angle `CFD` is also double of the angle `CFL`, and the angle `DLC` of the angle `FLC`.
Now, since the circumference `BC` is equal to `CD`, the angle `BFC` is also equal to the angle `CFD`. [elem.3.27]
And the angle `BFC` is double of the angle `KFC`, and the angle `DFC` of the angle `LFC`; > therefore the angle `KFC` is also equal to the angle `LFC`.
But the angle `FCK` is also equal to the angle `FCL`; therefore `FKC`, `FLC` are two triangles having two angles equal to two angles and one side equal to one side, namely `FC` which is common to them; therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides, and the remaining angle to the remaining angle; [elem.1.26] > therefore the straight line `KC` is equal to `CL`, and the angle `FKC` to the angle `FLC`.
And, since `KC` is equal to `CL`, therefore `KL` is double of `KC`.
For the same reason it can be proved that > `HK` is also double of `BK`.
And `BK` is equal to `KC`; > therefore `HK` is also equal to `KL`.
Similarly each of the straight lines `HG`, `GM`, `ML` can also be proved equal to each of the straight lines `HK`, `KL`; > therefore the pentagon `GHKLM` is equilateral.
I say next that it is also equiangular.
For, since the angle `FKC` is equal to the angle `FLC`, and the angle `HKL` was proved double of the angle `FKC`, > and the angle `KLM` double of the angle `FLC`, therefore the angle `HKL` is also equal to the angle `KLM`.
Similarly each of the angles `KHG`, `HGM`, `GML` can also be proved equal to each of the angles `HKL`, `KLM`; therefore the five angles `GHK`, `HKL`, `KLM`, `LMG`, `MGH` are equal to one another.
Therefore the pentagon `GHKLM` is equiangular.
And it was also proved equilateral; and it has been circumscribed about the circle `ABCDE`. Q. E. F.
