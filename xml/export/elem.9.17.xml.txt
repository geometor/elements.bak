Proof:
For let there be as many numbers as we please, , , , , in continued proportion, and let the extremes of them, , , be prime to one another; I say that  is not to any other number as  is to .
For, if possible, as  is to , so let  be to ; therefore, alternately, as  is to , so is  to . [elem.7.13]
But ,  are prime, primes are also least, [elem.7.21] and the least numbers measure those which have the same ratio the same number of times, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent. [elem.7.20]
Therefore  measures .
And, as  is to , so is  to .
Therefore  also measures ; so that  also measures .
And since, as  is to , so is  to , and  measures , therefore  also measures .
But  measured ; so that  also measures .
But it also measures itself; therefore  measures ,  which are prime to one another : which is impossible.
Therefore  will not be to any other number as  is to . Q. E. D.
