Enunciation:
> Any solid angle is contained by plane angles less than four right angles.

Proof:
Let the angle at > A be a solid angle contained by the plane angles > BAC, > CAD, > DAB; I say that the angles > BAC, > CAD, > DAB are less than four right angles.
For let points > B, > C, > D be taken at random on the straight lines > AB, > AC, > AD respectively, and let > BC, > CD, > DB be joined.
Now, since the solid angle at > B is contained by the three plane angles > CBA, > ABD, > CBD, any two are greater than the remaining one; [elem.11.20] therefore the angles > CBA, > ABD are greater than the angle > CBD.
For the same reason the angles > BCA, > ACD are also greater than the angle > BCD, and the angles > CDA, > ADB are greater than the angle > CDB; therefore the six angles > CBA, > ABD, > BCA, > ACD, > CDA, > ADB are greater than the three angles > CBD, > BCD, > CDB.
But the three angles > CBD, > BDC, > BCD are equal to two right angles; [elem.1.32] therefore the six angles > CBA, > ABD, > BCA, > ACD, > CDA, > ADB are greater than two right angles.
And, since the three angles of each of the triangles > ABC, > ACD, > ADB are equal to two right angles, therefore the nine angles of the three triangles, the angles > CBA, > ACB, > BAC, > ACD, > CDA, > CAD, > ADB, > DBA, > BAD are equal to six right angles; and of them the six angles > ABC, > BCA, > ACD, > CDA, > ADB, > DBA are greater than two right angles; therefore the remaining three angles > BAC, > CAD, > DAB containing the solid angle are less than four right angles.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
