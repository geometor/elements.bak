> Commensurable magnitudes have to one another the ratio which a number has to a number.

Proof:
Let > A, > B be commensurable magnitudes; I say that > A has to > B the ratio which a number has to a number.
For, since > A, > B are commensurable, some magnitude will measure them.
Let it measure them, and let it be > C.
And, as many times as > C measures > A, so many units let there be in > D; and, as many times as > C measures > B, so many units let there be in > E.
Since then > C measures > A according to the units in > D, while the unit also measures > D according to the units in it, therefore the unit measures the number > D the same number of times as the magnitude > C measures > A; therefore, as > C is to > A, so is the unit to > D; [elem.7.def.20] therefore, inversely, as > A is to > C, so is > D to the unit. [cf. elem.5.7.p.1]
Again, since > C measures > B according to the units in > E, while the unit also measures > E according to the units in it, therefore the unit measures > E the same number of times as > C measures > B; therefore, as > C is to > B, so is the unit to > E.
But it was also proved that, > as > A is to > C, so is > D to the unit; therefore, , > as > A is to > B, so is the number > D to > E. [elem.5.22]
Therefore the commensurable magnitudes > A, > B have to one another the ratio which the number > D has to the number > E. Q. E. D.
