Proof:
Let ,  be commensurable magnitudes; I say that  has to  the ratio which a number has to a number.
For, since ,  are commensurable, some magnitude will measure them.
Let it measure them, and let it be .
And, as many times as  measures , so many units let there be in ; and, as many times as  measures , so many units let there be in .
Since then  measures  according to the units in , while the unit also measures  according to the units in it, therefore the unit measures the number  the same number of times as the magnitude  measures ; therefore, as  is to , so is the unit to ; [elem.7.def.20] therefore, inversely, as  is to , so is  to the unit. [cf. elem.5.7.p.1]
Again, since  measures  according to the units in , while the unit also measures  according to the units in it,  the same number of times as  measures ; therefore, as  is to , so is the unit to .
But it was also proved that,  therefore, ,
Therefore the commensurable magnitudes ,  have to one another the ratio which the number  has to the number . Q. E. D.
