Enunciation:
`If two circles cut one another`, `they will not have the same centre`.

Proof:
For let the circles `ABC`, `CDG` cut one another at the points `B`, `C`; I say that they will not have the same centre.
For, if possible, let it be `E`; let `EC` be joined, and let `EFG` be drawn through at random.
Then, since the point `E` is the centre of the circle `ABC`, > `EC` is equal to `EF`. [elem.1.def.15]
Again, since the point `E` is the centre of the circle `CDG`, > `EC` is equal to `EG`.
But `EC` was proved equal to `EF` also; > therefore `EF` is also equal to `EG`, the less to the greater : which is impossible.
Therefore the point `E` is not the centre of the circles `ABC`, `CDG`.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
