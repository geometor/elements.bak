Proof:
For, as in the foregoing figures, let there be subtracted from the medial area  the medial area  incommensurable with the whole;  I say that the 
 of  is one of two irrational straight lines, either a second apotome of a medial straight line or a straight line which produces with a medial area a medial whole.
For, since each of the rectangles ,  is medial, and  is incommensurable with , it follows that each of the straight lines ,  will be rational and incommensurable in length with . [elem.10.22]
And, since  is incommensurable with , that is,  with ,  is also incommensurable with ; [elem.6.1, elem.10.11] therefore ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore  is an apotome. [elem.10.73]
If then the square on  is greater than the square on  by the square on a straight line commensurable with , while neither of the straight lines ,  is commensurable in length with the rational straight line  set out,  is a third apotome. [elem.10.def.3.3]
But  is rational, and the rectangle contained by a rational straight line and a third apotome is irrational, and the 
 of it is irrational, and is called a second apotome of a medial straight line; [elem.10.93] so that the 
 of , that is, of , is a second apotome of a medial straight line.
But, if the square on  is greater than the square on  by the square on a straight line incommensurable with , while neither of the straight lines ,  is commensurable in length with ,  is a sixth apotome. [elem.10.def.3.6]
But the 
 of the rectangle contained by a rational straight line and a sixth apotome is a straight line which produces with a medial area a medial whole. [elem.10.96]
Therefore the 
 of , that is, of , is a straight line which produces with a medial area a medial whole. Q. E. D.
