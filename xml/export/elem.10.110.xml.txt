Enunciation:
> If from a medial area there be subtracted a medial area incommensurable with the whole, the two remaining irrational straight lines arise, either a second apotome of a medial straight line or a straight line which produces with a medial area a medial whole.

Proof:
For, as in the foregoing figures, let there be subtracted from the medial area > BC the medial area > BD incommensurable with the whole;  I say that the 
 of > EC is one of two irrational straight lines, either a second apotome of a medial straight line or a straight line which produces with a medial area a medial whole.
For, since each of the rectangles > BC, > BD is medial, and > BC is incommensurable with > BD, it follows that each of the straight lines > FH, > FK will be rational and incommensurable in length with > FG. [elem.10.22]
And, since > BC is incommensurable with > BD, that is, > GH with > GK, > HF is also incommensurable with > FK; [elem.6.1, elem.10.11] therefore > FH, > FK are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore > KH is an apotome. [elem.10.73]
If then the square on > FH is greater than the square on > FK by the square on a straight line commensurable with > FH, while neither of the straight lines > FH, > FK is commensurable in length with the rational straight line > FG set out, > KH is a third apotome. [elem.10.def.3.3]
But > KL is rational, and the rectangle contained by a rational straight line and a third apotome is irrational, and the 
 of it is irrational, and is called a second apotome of a medial straight line; [elem.10.93] so that the 
 of > LH, that is, of > EC, is a second apotome of a medial straight line.
But, if the square on > FH is greater than the square on > FK by the square on a straight line incommensurable with > FH, while neither of the straight lines > HF, > FK is commensurable in length with > FG, > KH is a sixth apotome. [elem.10.def.3.6]
But the 
 of the rectangle contained by a rational straight line and a sixth apotome is a straight line which produces with a medial area a medial whole. [elem.10.96]
Therefore the 
 of > LH, that is, of > EC, is a straight line which produces with a medial area a medial whole. Q. E. D.
