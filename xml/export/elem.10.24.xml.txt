Enunciation:
> The rectangle contained by medial straight lines commensurable in length is medial.

Proof:
For let the rectangle > AC be contained by the medial straight lines > AB, > BC which are commensurable in length; I say that > AC is medial.
For on > AB let the square > AD be described; therefore > AD is medial.
And, since > AB is commensurable in length with > BC, while > AB is equal to > BD, therefore > DB is also commensurable in length with > BC; so that > DA is also commensurable with > AC. [elem.6.1, elem.10.11]
But > DA is medial; therefore > AC is also medial. [elem.10.23.p.1] Q. E. D.
