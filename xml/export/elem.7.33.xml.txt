> Given as many numbers as we please, to find the least of those which have the same ratio with them.

Proof:
Let > A, > B, > C be the given numbers, as many as we please; thus it is required to find the least of those which have the same ratio with > A, > B, > C.
> A, > B, > C are either prime to one another or not.
Now, if > A, > B, > C are prime to one another, they are the least of those which have the same ratio with them. [elem.7.21]
But, if not, let > D the greatest common measure of > A, > B, > C be taken, [elem.7.3] and, as many times as > D measures the numbers > A, > B, > C
       respectively, so many units let there be in the numbers > E, > F, > G respectively.
Therefore the numbers > E, > F, > G measure the numbers > A, > B, > C respectively according to the units in > D. [elem.7.16]
Therefore > E, > F, > G measure > A, > B, > C the same number of times; therefore > E, > F, > G are in the same ratio with > A, > B, > C. [elem.7.def.20]
I say next that they are the least that are in that ratio.
For, if > E, > F, > G are not the least of those which have the same ratio with > A, > B, > C, there will be numbers less than > E, > F, > G which are in the same ratio with > A, > B, > C.
Let them be > H, > K, > L; therefore > H measures > A the same number of times that the numbers > K, > L measure the numbers > B, > C respectively.
Now, as many times as > H measures > A, so many units let there be in > M; therefore the numbers > K, > L also measure the numbers > B, > C respectively according to the units in > M.
And, since > H measures > A according to the units in > M, therefore > M also measures > A according to the units in > H. [elem.7.16]
For the same reason > M also measures the numbers > B, > C according to the units in the numbers > K, > L respectively;
Therefore > M measures > A, > B, > C.
Now, since > H measures > A according to the units in > M, therefore > H by multiplying > M has made > A. [elem.7.def.15]
For the same reason also > E by multiplying > D has made > A.
Therefore the product of > E, > D is equal to the product of > H, > M.
Therefore, as > E is to > H, so is > M to > D. [elem.7.19]
But > E is greater than > H; therefore > M is also greater than > D.
And it measures > A, > B, > C: which is impossible, for by hypothesis > D is the greatest common measure of > A, > B, > C.
Therefore there cannot be any numbers less than > E, > F, > G which are in the same ratio with > A, > B, > C.
Therefore > E, > F, > G are the least of those which have the same ratio with > A, > B, > C. Q. E. D.
