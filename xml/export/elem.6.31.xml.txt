Enunciation:
`In right`-`angled triangles the figure on the side subtending the right angle is equal to the similar and similarly described figures on the sides containing the right angle`.

Proof:
Let `ABC` be a right-angled triangle having the angle `BAC` right; I say that the figure on `BC` is equal to the similar and similarly described figures on `BA`, `AC`.
Let `AD` be drawn perpendicular.
Then since, in the right-angled triangle `ABC`, `AD` has `A` perpendicular to the base `BC`, the triangles `ABD`, `ADC` adjoining the perpendicular are similar both to the whole `ABC` and to one another. [elem.6.8]
And, since `ABC` is similar to `ABD`, therefore, as `CB` is to `BA`, so is `AB` to `BD`. [elem.6.def.1]
And, since three straight lines are proportional, as the first is to the third, so is the figure on the first to the similar and similarly described figure on the second. [elem.6.19.p.1]
Therefore, as `CB` is to `BD`, so is the figure on `CB` to the similar and similarly described figure on `BA`.
For the same reason also, as `BC` is to `CD`, so is the figure on `BC` to that on `CA`; so that, in addition, as `BC` is to `BD`, `DC`, so is the figure on `BC` to the similar and similarly described figures on `BA`, `AC`.
But `BC` is equal to `BD`, `DC`; therefore the figure on `BC` is also equal to the similar and similarly described figures on `BA`, `AC`.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
