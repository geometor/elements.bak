> If an equilateral triangle be inscribed in a circle, > the square on the side of the triangle is triple of the square on the radius of the circle.

Proof:
Let > ABC be a circle, and let the equilateral triangle > ABC be inscribed in it; I say that the square on one side of the triangle > ABC is triple of the square on the radius of the circle.
For let the centre > D of the circle > ABC be taken, let > AD be joined and carried through to > E, and let > BE be joined.
Then, since the triangle > ABC is equilateral, therefore the circumference > BEC is a third part of the circumference of the circle > ABC.
Therefore the circumference > BE is a sixth part of the circumference of the circle; therefore the straight line > BE belongs to a hexagon; therefore it is equal to the radius > DE. [elem.4.15.p.1]
And, since > AE is double of > DE, the square on > AE is quadruple of the square on > ED, that is, of the square on > BE.
But the square on > AE is equal to the squares on > AB, > BE; [elem.3.31, elem.1.47] therefore the squares on > AB, > BE are quadruple of the square on > BE.
Therefore, , the square on > AB is triple of the square on > BE.
But > BE is equal to > DE; therefore the square on > AB is triple of the square on > DE.
Therefore the square on the side of the triangle is triple of the square on the radius. Q. E. D.
