Enunciation:
`If a straight line touch a circle`, `and from the point of contact a straight line be drawn at right angles to the tangent`, `the centre of the circle will be on the straight line so drawn`.

Proof:
For let a straight line `DE` touch the circle `ABC` at the point `C`, and from `C` let `CA` be drawn at right angles to `DE`; I say that the centre of the circle is on `AC`.
For suppose it is not, but, if  possible, let `F` be the centre, and let `CF` be joined.
Since a straight line `DE` touches the circle `ABC`, and `FC` has been joined from the centre to the point of contact, > `FC` is perpendicular to `DE`; [elem.3.18] therefore the angle `FCE` is right.
But the angle `ACE` is also right; > therefore the angle `FCE` is equal to the angle `ACE`, the less to the greater: which is impossible.
Therefore `F` is not the centre of the circle `ABC`.
Similarly we can prove that neither is any other point except a point on `AC`.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
