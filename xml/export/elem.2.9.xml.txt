Enunciation:
`If a straight line be cut into equal and unequal segments`, `the squares on the unequal segments of the whole are double of the square on the half and of the square on the straight line between the points of section`.

Proof:
For let a straight line `AB` be cut into equal segments at `C`, and into unequal segments at `D`;
I say that the squares on `AD`, `DB` are double of the squares on `AC`, `CD`.
For let `CE` be drawn from `C` at right angles to `AB`, and let it be made equal to either `AC` or `CB`; let `EA`, `EB` be joined, let `DF` be drawn through `D` parallel to `EC`, and `FG` through `F` parallel to `AB`, and let `AF` be joined.
Then, since `AC` is equal to `CE`,
And, since the angle at `C` is right,
And they are equal;
For the same reason
And, since the angle `GEF` is half a right angle, `EGF` is right, for it is equal to the interior and opposite angle `ECB`, [elem.1.29]
Again, since the angle at `B` is half a right angle, and the angle `FDB` is right, for it is again equal to the interior and opposite angle `ECB`, [elem.1.29]
Now, since `AC` is equal to `CE`,
But the square on `EA` is equal to the squares on `AC`, `CE`, for the angle `ACE` is right; [elem.1.47]
Again, since `EG` is equal to `GF`,
But the square on `EF` is equal to the squares on `EG`, `GF`;
But `GF` is equal to `CD`; [elem.1.34] therefore the square on `EF` is double of the square on `CD`.
But the square on `EA` is also double of the square on `AC`;
And the square on `AF` is equal to the squares on `AE`, `EF`, for the angle `AEF` is right; [elem.1.47] therefore the square on `AF` is double of the squares on `AC`, `CD`.
But the squares on `AD`, `DF` are equal to the square on `AF`, for the angle at `D` is right; [elem.1.47] therefore the squares on `AD`, `DF` are double of the squares on `AC`, `CD`.
And `DF` is equal to `DB`; therefore the squares on `AD`, `DB` are double of the squares on `AC`, `CD`.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
