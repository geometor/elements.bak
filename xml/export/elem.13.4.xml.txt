> If a straight line be cut in extreme and mean ratio, > the square on the whole and the square on the lesser segment together are triple of the square on the greater segment.

Proof:
Let > AB be a straight line, let it be cut in extreme and mean ratio at > C, and let > AC be the greater segment; I say that the squares on > AB, > BC are triple of the square on > CA.
For let the square > ADEB be described on > AB, and let the figure be drawn.
Since then > AB has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at > C, and > AC is the greater segment, therefore the rectangle > AB, > BC is equal to the square on > AC. [elem.6.def.3, elem.6.17]
And > AK is the rectangle > AB, > BC, and > HG the square on > AC; therefore > AK is equal to > HG.
And, since > AF is equal to > FE, let > CK be added to each; therefore the whole > AK is equal to the whole > CE; therefore > AK, > CE are double of > AK.
But > AK, > CE are the gnomon > LMN and the square > CK; therefore the gnomon > LMN and the square > CK are double of > AK.
But, further, > AK was also proved equal to > HG; therefore the gnomon > LMN and the squares > CK, > HG are triple of the square > HG.
And the gnomon > LMN and the squares > CK, > HG are the whole square > AE and > CK, which are the squares on > AB, > BC, while > HG is the square on > AC.
Therefore the squares on > AB, > BC are triple of the square on > AC. Q. E. D.
