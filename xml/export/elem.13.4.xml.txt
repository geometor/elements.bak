Proof:
Let  be a straight line, let it be cut in extreme and mean ratio at , and let  be the greater segment; I say that the squares on ,  are triple of the square on .
For let the square  be described on , and let the figure be drawn.
Since then  has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at , and  is the greater segment, therefore the rectangle ,  is equal to the square on . [elem.6.def.3, elem.6.17]
And  is the rectangle , , and  the square on ; therefore  is equal to .
And, since  is equal to , let  be added to each; therefore the whole  is equal to the whole ; therefore ,  are double of .
But ,  are the gnomon  and the square ; therefore the gnomon  and the square  are double of .
But, further,  was also proved equal to ; therefore the gnomon  and the squares ,  are triple of the square .
And the gnomon  and the squares ,  are the whole square  and , which are the squares on , , while  is the square on .
Therefore the squares on ,  are triple of the square on . Q. E. D.
