Enunciation:
`If in a right-angled triangle a perpendicular be drawn from the right angle to the base`, `the triangles adjoining the perpendicular are similar both to the whole and to one another`.

Proof:
Let `ABC` be a right-angled triangle having the angle `BAC` right, and let `AD` be drawn from `A` perpendicular to `BC`; I say that each of the triangles `ABD`, `ADC` is similar to the whole `ABC` and, further, they are similar to one another.
For, since the angle `BAC` is equal to the angle `ADB`, for each is right, and the angle at `B` is common to the two triangles `ABC` and `ABD`, therefore the remaining angle `ACB` is equal to the remaining angle `BAD`; [elem.1.32] `ABC` is equiangular with the triangle `ABD`.
Therefore, as `BC` which subtends the right angle in the triangle `ABC` is to `BA` which subtends the right angle in the triangle `ABD`, so is `AB` itself which subtends the angle at `C` in the triangle `ABC` to `BD` which subtends the equal angle `BAD` in the triangle `ABD`, and so also is `AC` to `AD` which subtends the angle at `B` common to the two triangles. [elem.6.4]
Therefore the triangle `ABC` is both equiangular to the triangle `ABD` and has the sides about the equal angles proportional.
Therefore the triangle `ABC` is similar to the triangle `ABD`. [elem.6.def.1]
Similarly we can prove that the triangle `ABC` is also similar to the triangle `ADC`; therefore each of the triangles `ABD`, `ADC` is similar to the whole `ABC`.
I say next that the triangles `ABD`, `ADC` are also similar to one another.
For, since the right angle `BDA` is equal to the right angle `ADC`, and moreover the angle `BAD` was also proved equal to the angle at `C`, therefore the remaining angle at `B` is also equal to the remaining angle `DAC`; [elem.1.32] therefore the triangle `ABD` is equiangular with the triangle `ADC`.
Therefore, as `BD` which subtends the angle `BAD` in the triangle `ABD` is to `DA` which subtends the angle at `C` in the triangle `ADC` equal to the angle `BAD`, so is `AD` itself which subtends the angle at `B` in the triangle `ABD` to `DC` which subtends the angle `DAC` in the triangle `ADC` equal `B`, and so also is `BA` to `AC`, these sides subtending the right angles; [elem.6.4] therefore the triangle `ABD` is similar to the triangle `ADC`. [elem.6.def.1]
Therefore etc.
