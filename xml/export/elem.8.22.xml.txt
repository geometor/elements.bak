Enunciation:
> If three numbers be in continued proportion, and the first be square, the third will also be square.

Proof:
Let > A, > B, > C be three numbers in continued proportion, and let > A the first be square; I say that > C the third is also square.
For, since between > A, > C there is one mean proportional number, > B, therefore > A, > C are similar plane numbers. [elem.8.20]
But > A is square; therefore > C is also square. Q. E. D.
