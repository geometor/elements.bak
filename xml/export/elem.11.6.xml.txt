Enunciation:
> If two straight lines be at right angles to the same plane, > the straight lines will be parallel.

Proof:
For let the two straight lines > AB, > CD be at right angles to the plane of reference; I say that > AB is parallel to > CD.
For let them meet the plane of reference at the points > B, > D, let the straight line > BD be joined, let > DE be drawn, in the plane of reference, at right angles to > BD, let > DE be made equal to > AB, and let > BE, > AE, > AD be joined.
Now, since > AB is at right angles to the plane of reference, it will also make right angles with all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane of reference. [elem.11.def.3]
But each of the straight lines > BD, > BE is in the plane of reference and meets > AB; therefore each of the angles > ABD, > ABE is right.
For the same reason each of the angles > CDB, > CDE is also right.
And, since > AB is equal to > DE, and > BD is common, the two sides > AB, > BD are equal to the two sides > ED, > DB; and they include right angles; therefore the base > AD is equal to the base > BE. [elem.1.4]
And, since > AB is equal to > DE, while > AD is also equal to > BE, the two sides > AB, > BE are equal to the two sides > ED, > DA; and > AE is their common base; therefore the angle > ABE is equal to the angle > EDA. [elem.1.8]
But the angle > ABE is right; therefore the angle > EDA is also right; therefore > ED is at right angles to > DA.
But it is also at right angles to each of the straight lines > BD, > DC; therefore > ED is set up at right angles to the three straight lines > BD, > DA, > DC at their point of meeting; therefore the three straight lines > BD, > DA, > DC are in one plane. [elem.11.5]
But, in whatever plane > DB, > DA are, in that plane is > AB also, for every triangle is in one plane; [elem.11.2] therefore the straight lines > AB, > BD, > DC are in one plane.
And each of the angles > ABD, > BDC is right; therefore > AB is parallel to > CD. [elem.1.28]
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
