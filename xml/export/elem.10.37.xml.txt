Enunciation:
> If two medial straight lines commensurable in square only and containing a rational rectangle be added together, the whole is irrational; and let it be called
       > a first bimedial
       > straight line.

Proof:
For let two medial straight lines > AB, > BC commensurable in square only and containing a rational rectangle be added together;  I say that the whole > AC is irrational.
For, since > AB is incommensurable in length with > BC, therefore the squares on > AB, > BC are also incommensurable with twice the rectangle > AB, > BC; [cf. elem.10.36]
and, , the squares on > AB, > BC together with twice the rectangle > AB, > BC, that is, the square on > AC [elem.2.4], is incommensurable with the rectangle > AB, > BC. [elem.10.16
]
But the rectangle > AB, > BC is rational, for, by hypothesis, > AB, > BC are straight lines containing a rational rectangle; therefore the square on > AC is irrational; therefore > AC is irrational. [elem.10.def.4
]
And let it be called a > first bimedial straight line. Q. E. D.
