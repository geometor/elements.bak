> Similar solid numbers have to one another the ratio which a cube number has to a cube number.

Proof:
Let > A, > B be similar solid numbers; I say that > A has to > B the ratio which a cube number has to a cube number.
For, since > A, > B are similar solid numbers, therefore two mean proportional numbers fall between > A, > B. [elem.8.19]
Let > C, > D so fall, and let > E, > F, > G, > H, the least numbers of those which have the same ratio with > A, > C, > D, > B, and equal with them in multitude, be taken; [elem.7.33 or elem.8.2] therefore the extremes of them > E, > H are cube. [elem.8.2.p.1]
And, as > E is to > H, so is > A to > B; therefore > A also has to > B the ratio which a cube number has to a cube number. Q. E. D.
