Enunciation:
> A part of a straight line cannot be in the plane of reference and a part in a plane more elevated.

Proof:
For, if possible, let a part > AB of the straight line > ABC be in the plane of reference, and a part > BC in a plane more elevated.
There will then be in the plane of reference some straight line continuous with > AB in a straight line.
Let it be > BD; therefore > AB is a common segment of the two straight lines > ABC, > ABD: which is impossible, inasmuch as, if we describe a circle with centre > B and distance > AB, the diameters will cut off unequal circumferences of the circle.
Therefore a part of a straight line cannot be in the plane of reference, and a part in a plane more elevated. Q. E. D.
