Enunciation:
If a straight line falling on two straight lines make the alternate angles equal to one another, the straight lines will be parallel to one another.

Proof:
For let the straight line `EF` falling on the two straight `AB`, `CD` make the alternate angles `AEF`, `EFD` equal to one another;
I say that `AB` is parallel to `CD`.
For, if not, `AB`, `CD` when produced will meet either in the direction `B`, `D` or towards `A`, `C`.
Let them be produced and meet, in the direction of `B`, `D`, at `G`.
Then, in the triangle `GEF`, the exterior angle `AEF` is equal to the interior and opposite `EFG`: which is impossible. [elem.1.16]
Therefore `AB`, `CD` when produced will not meet in the direction of `B`, `D`.
Similarly it can be proved that neither will they meet `A`, `C`.
But straight lines which do not meet in either direction are parallel; [elem.1.def.23]
Therefore etc.
