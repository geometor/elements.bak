Enunciation:
The straight lines joining equal and parallel straight lines (at the extremities which are) in the same directions (respectively) are themselves also equal and parallel.

Proof:
Let `AB`, `CD` be equal and parallel, and let the straight  lines `AC`, `BD` join them (at the extremities which are) in the same directions (respectively); I say that `AC`, `BD` are also equal and parallel.
Let `BC` be joined.
Then, since `AB` is parallel to `CD`,  and `BC` has fallen upon them,
And, since `AB` is equal to `CD`,
And, since the straight line `BC` falling on the two straight lines `AC`, `BD` has made the alternate angles equal to one another,
And it was also proved equal to it.
Therefore etc.
