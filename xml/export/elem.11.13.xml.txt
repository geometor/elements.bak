Proof:
For, if possible, from the same point  let the two straight lines ,  be set up at right angles to the plane of reference and on the same side, and let a plane be drawn through , ; it will then make, as section through  in the plane of reference, a straight line. [elem.11.3]
Let it make ; therefore the straight lines , ,  are in one plane.
And, since  is at right angles to the plane of reference, it will also make right angles with all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane of reference. [elem.11.def.3]
But  meets it and is in the plane of reference; therefore the angle  is right.
For the same reason the angle  is also right; therefore the angle  is equal to the angle .
And they are in one plane: which is impossible.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
