Enunciation:
> From the same point two straight lines cannot be set up at right angles to the same plane on the same side.

Proof:
For, if possible, from the same point > A let the two straight lines > AB, > AC be set up at right angles to the plane of reference and on the same side, and let a plane be drawn through > BA, > AC; it will then make, as section through > A in the plane of reference, a straight line. [elem.11.3]
Let it make > DAE; therefore the straight lines > AB, > AC, > DAE are in one plane.
And, since > CA is at right angles to the plane of reference, it will also make right angles with all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane of reference. [elem.11.def.3]
But > DAE meets it and is in the plane of reference; therefore the angle > CAE is right.
For the same reason the angle > BAE is also right; therefore the angle > CAE is equal to the angle > BAE.
And they are in one plane: which is impossible.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
