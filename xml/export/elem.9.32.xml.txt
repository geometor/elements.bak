Enunciation:
> Each of the numbers which are continually doubled beginning from a dyad is even-times even only.

Proof:
For let as many numbers as we please, > B, > C, > D, have been continually doubled beginning from the dyad > A; I say that > B, > C, > D are eventimes even only.
Now that each of the numbers > B, > C, > D is even-times even is manifest; for it is doubled from a dyad.
I say that it is also even-times even only.
For let an unit be set out.
Since then as many numbers as we please beginning from an unit are in continued proportion, and the number > A after the unit is prime, therefore > D, the greatest of the numbers > A, > B, > C, > D, will not be measured by any other number except > A, > B, > C. [elem.9.13]
And each of the numbers > A, > B, > C is even; therefore > D is even-times even only. [elem.7.def.8]
Similarly we can prove that each of the numbers > B, > C is even-times even only. Q. E. D.
