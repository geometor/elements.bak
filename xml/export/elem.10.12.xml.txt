> Magnitudes commensurable with the same magnitude are commensurable with one another also.

Proof:
For let each of the magnitudes > A, > B be commensurable with > C; I say that > A is also commensurable with > B.
For, since > A is commensurable with > C, therefore > A has to > C the ratio which a number has to a number. [elem.10.5]
Let it have the ratio which > D has to > E.
Again, since > C is commensurable with > B, therefore > C has to > B the ratio which a number has to a number. [elem.10.5]
Let it have the ratio which > F has to > G.
And, given any number of ratios we please, namely the ratio which > D has to > E and that which > F has to > G, let the numbers > H, > K, > L be taken continuously in the given ratios; [cf. elem.8.4] so that, as > D is to > E, so is > H to > K, > and, as > F is to > G, so is > K to > L.
Since, then, as > A is to > C, so is > D to > E, while, as > D is to > E, so is > H to > K, therefore also, as > A is to > C, so is > H to > K. [elem.5.11]
Again, since, as > C is to > B, so is > F to > G, while, as > F is to > G, so is > K to > L, therefore also, as > C is to > B, so is > K to > L. [elem.5.11]
But also, as > A is to > C, so is > H to > K; therefore, , as > A is to > B, so is > H to > L. [elem.5.22]
Therefore > A has to > B the ratio which a number has to a number; therefore > A is commensurable with > B. [elem.10.6]
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
