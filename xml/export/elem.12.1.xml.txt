Enunciation:
> Similar polygons inscribed in circles are to one another as the squares on the diameters.

Proof:
Let > ABC, > FGH be circles, let > ABCDE, > FGHKL be similar polygons inscribed in them, and let > BM, > GN be diameters of the circles; I say that, as the square on > BM is to the square on > GN, so is the polygon > ABCDE to the polygon > FGHKL.
For let > BE, > AM, > GL, > FN be joined.
Now, since the polygon > ABCDE is similar to the polygon > FGHKL, the angle > BAE is equal to the angle > GFL, and, as > BA is to > AE, so is > GF to > FL. [VI. Def. I]
Thus > BAE, > GFL are two triangles which have one angle equal to one angle, namely the angle > BAE to the angle > GFL, and the sides about the equal angles proportional; therefore the triangle > ABE is equiangular with the triangle > FGL. [elem.6.6]
Therefore the angle > AEB is equal to the angle > FLG.
But the angle > AEB is equal to the angle > AMB, for they stand on the same circumference; [elem.3.27] and the angle > FLG to the angle > FNG; therefore the angle > AMB is also equal to the angle > FNG.
But the right angle > BAM is also equal to the right angle > GFN; [elem.3.31] therefore the remaining angle is equal to the remaining angle. [elem.1.32]
Therefore the triangle > ABM is equiangular with the triangle > FGN.
Therefore, proportionally, as > BM is to > GN, so is > BA to > GF. [elem.6.4]
But the ratio of the square on > BM to the square on > GN is duplicate of the ratio of > BM to > GN, and the ratio of the polygon > ABCDE to the polygon > FGHKL is duplicate of the ratio of > BA to > GF; [elem.6.20] therefore also, as the square on > BM is to the square on > GN, so is the polygon > ABCDE to the polygon > FGHKL.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
