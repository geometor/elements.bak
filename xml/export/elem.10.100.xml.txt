> The square on a minor straight line applied to a rational straight line produces as breadth a fourth apotome.

Proof:
Let > AB be a minor and > CD a rational straight line, and to the rational straight line > CD let > CE be applied equal to the square on > AB and producing > CF as breadth; I say that > CF is a fourth apotome.
For let > BG be the annex to > AB; therefore > AG, > GB are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on > AG, > GB rational, but twice the rectangle > AG, > GB medial. [elem.10.76]
To > CD let there be applied > CH equal to the square on > AG and producing > CK as breadth, and > KL equal to the square on > BG, producing > KM as breadth; therefore the whole > CL is equal to the squares on > AG, > GB.
And the sum of the squares on > AG, > GB is rational; therefore > CL is also rational.
And it is applied to the rational straight line > CD, producing > CM as breadth; therefore > CM is also rational and commensurable in length with > CD. [elem.10.20]
And, since the whole > CL is equal to the squares on > AG, > GB, and, in these, > CE is equal to the square on > AB, therefore the remainder > FL is equal to twice the rectangle > AG, > GB. [elem.2.7]
Let then > FM be bisected at the point > N, and let > NO be drawn through > N parallel to either of the straight lines > CD, > ML; therefore each of the rectangles > FO, > NL is equal to the rectangle > AG, > GB.
And, since twice the rectangle > AG, > GB is medial and is equal to > FL, therefore > FL is also medial.
And it is applied to the rational straight line > FE, producing > FM as breadth; therefore > FM is rational and incommensurable in length with > CD. [elem.10.22]
And, since the sum of the squares on > AG, > GB is rational, while twice the rectangle > AG, > GB is medial, the squares on > AG, > GB are incommensurable with twice the rectangle > AG, > GB.
But > CL is equal to the squares on > AG, > GB, and > FL equal to twice the rectangle > AG, > GB; therefore > CL is incommensurable with > FL.
But, as > CL is to > FL, so is > CM to > MF; [elem.6.1] therefore > CM is incommensurable in length with > MF. [elem.10.11]
And both are rational; therefore > CM, > MF are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore > CF is an apotome. [elem.10.73]
I say that it is also a fourth apotome.
For, since > AG, > GB are incommensurable in square, therefore the square on > AG is also incommensurable with the square on > GB.
And > CH is equal to the square on > AG, and > KL equal to the square on > GB; therefore > CH is incommensurable with > KL.
But, as > CH is to > KL, so is > CK to > KM; [elem.6.1] therefore > CK is incommensurable in length with > KM. [elem.10.11]
And, since the rectangle > AG, > GB is a mean proportional between the squares on > AG, > GB, and the square on > AG is equal to > CH, the square on > GB to > KL, and the rectangle > AG, > GB to > NL, therefore > NL is a mean proportional between > CH, > KL; therefore, as > CH is to > NL, so is > NL to > KL.
But, as > CH is to > NL, so is > CK to > NM, and, as > NL is to > KL, so is > NM to > KM; [elem.6.1] therefore, as > CK is to > MN, so is > MN to > KM; [elem.5.11] therefore the rectangle > CK, > KM is equal to the square on > MN [elem.6.17], that is, to the fourth part of the square on > FM.
Since then > CM, > MF are two unequal straight lines, and the rectangle > CK, > KM equal to the fourth part of the square on > MF and deficient by a square figure has been applied to > CM and divides it into incommensurable parts, therefore the square on > CM is greater than the square on > MF by the square on a straight line incommensurable with > CM. [elem.10.18]
And the whole > CM is commensurable in length with the rational straight line > CD set out; therefore > CF is a fourth apotome. [elem.10.def.3.4]
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
