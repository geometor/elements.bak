Proof:
For let the rectangle > AC be contained by the rational straight lines > AB, > BC commensurable in square only; I say that > AC is irrational, and the side of the square equal to it is irrational; and let the latter be called > medial.
For on > AB let the square > AD be described; therefore > AD is rational. [elem.10.def.4]
And, since > AB is incommensurable in length with > BC, for by hypothesis they are commensurable in square only, while > AB is equal to > BD, therefore > DB is also incommensurable in length with > BC.
And, as > DB is to > BC, so is > AD to > AC; [elem.6.1] therefore > DA is incommensurable with > AC. [elem.10.11]
But > DA is rational; therefore > AC is irrational, so that the side of the square equal to > AC is also irrational. [elem.10.def.4]
And let the latter be called > medial. Q. E. D.
