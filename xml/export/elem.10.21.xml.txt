Proof:
For let the rectangle  be contained by the rational straight lines ,  commensurable in square only;  is irrational, and the side of the square equal to it is irrational; and let the latter be called
For on  let the square  be described; therefore  is rational. [elem.10.def.4]
And, since  is incommensurable in length with , for by hypothesis they are commensurable in square only, while  is equal to , therefore  is also incommensurable in length with .
And, as  is to , so is  to ; [elem.6.1] therefore  is incommensurable with . [elem.10.11]
But  is rational; therefore  is irrational, so that the side of the square equal to  is also irrational. [elem.10.def.4]
And let the latter be called  Q. E. D.
