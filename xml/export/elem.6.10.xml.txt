Enunciation:
`To cut a given uncut straight line similarly to a given cut straight line`.

Proof:
Let `AB` be the given uncut straight line, and `AC` the straight line cut at the points `D`, `E`; and let them be so placed as to contain any angle; let `CB` be joined, and through `D`, `E` let `DF`, `EG` be drawn parallel to `BC`, and through `D` let `DHK` be drawn parallel to `AB`. [elem.1.31]
Therefore each of the figures `FH`, `HB` is a parallelogram; therefore `DH` is equal to `FG` and `HK` to `GB`. [elem.1.34]
Now, since the straight line `HE` has been drawn parallel to `KC`, one of the sides of the triangle `DKC`, therefore, proportionally, as `CE` is to `ED`, so is `KH` to `HD`. [elem.6.2]
But `KH` is equal to `BG`, and `HD` to `GF`; therefore, as `CE` is to `ED`, so is `BG` to `GF`.
Again, since `FD` has been drawn parallel to `GE`, one of the sides of the triangle `AGE`, therefore, proportionally, as `ED` is to `DA`, so is `GF` to `FA`. [elem.6.2]
But it was also proved that, > as `CE` is to `ED`, so is `BG` to `GF`; therefore, as `CE` is to `ED`, so is `BG` to `GF`, and, as `ED` is to `DA`, so is `GF` to `FA`.
Therefore the given uncut straight line `AB` has been cut similarly to the given cut straight line `AC`. Q. E. F.
