Enunciation:
> If the sides of the opposite planes of a cube be bisected, > and planes be carried through the points of section, > the common section of the planes and the diameter of the cube bisect one another.

Proof:
For let the sides of the opposite planes > CF, > AH of the cube > AF be bisected at the points > K, > L, > M, > N, > O, > Q, > P, > R, and through the points of section let the planes > KN, > OR be carried; let > US be the common section of the planes, and > DG the diameter of the cube > AF.
I say that > UT is equal to > TS, and > DT to > TG.
For let > DU, > UE, > BS, > SG be joined.
Then, since > DO is parallel to > PE, the alternate angles > DOU, > UPE are equal to one another. [elem.1.29]
And, since > DO is equal to > PE, and > OU to > UP, and they contain equal angles, therefore the base > DU is equal to the base > UE, the triangle > DOU is equal to the triangle > PUE, and the remaining angles are equal to the remaining angles; [elem.1.4] therefore the angle > OUD is equal to the angle > PUE.
For this reason > DUE is a straight line. [elem.1.14]
For the same reason, > BSG is also a straight line, and > BS is equal to > SG.
Now, since > CA is equal and parallel to > DB, while > CA is also equal and parallel to > EG, therefore > DB is also equal and parallel to > EG. [elem.11.9]
And the straight lines > DE, > BG join their extremities; therefore > DE is parallel to > BG. [elem.1.33]
Therefore the angle > EDT is equal to the angle > BGT, for they are alternate; [elem.1.29] and the angle > DTU is equal to the angle > GTS. [elem.1.15]
Therefore > DTU, > GTS are two triangles which have two angles equal to two angles, and one side equal to one side, namely that subtending one of the equal angles, that is, > DU equal to > GS, for they are the halves of > DE, > BG; therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides. [elem.1.26]
Therefore > DT is equal to > TG, and > UT to > TS.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
