Proof:
For let the sides of the opposite planes ,  of the cube  be bisected at the points , , , , , , , , and through the points of section let the planes ,  be carried; let  be the common section of the planes, and  the diameter of the cube .
I say that  is equal to , and  to .
For let , , ,  be joined.
Then, since  is parallel to , the alternate angles ,  are equal to one another. [elem.1.29]
And, since  is equal to , and  to , and they contain equal angles, therefore the base  is equal to the base , the triangle  is equal to the triangle , and the remaining angles are equal to the remaining angles; [elem.1.4] therefore the angle  is equal to the angle .
For this reason  is a straight line. [elem.1.14]
For the same reason,  is also a straight line, and  is equal to .
Now, since  is equal and parallel to , while  is also equal and parallel to , therefore  is also equal and parallel to . [elem.11.9]
And the straight lines ,  join their extremities; therefore  is parallel to . [elem.1.33]
Therefore the angle  is equal to the angle , for they are alternate; [elem.1.29] and the angle  is equal to the angle . [elem.1.15]
Therefore ,  are two triangles which have two angles equal to two angles, and one side equal to one side, namely that subtending one of the equal angles, that is,  equal to , for they are the halves of , ; therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides. [elem.1.26]
Therefore  is equal to , and  to .
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
