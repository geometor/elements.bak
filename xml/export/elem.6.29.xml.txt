Enunciation:
`To a given straight line to apply a parallelogram equal to a given rectilineal figure and exceeding by a parallelogrammic figure similar to a given one`.

Proof:
Let `AB` be the given straight line, `C` the given rectilineal figure to which the figure to be applied to `AB` is required to be equal, and `D` that to which the excess is required to be similar; thus it is required to apply to the straight line `AB` a parallelogram equal to the rectilineal figure `C` and exceeding by a parallelogrammic figure similar to `D`.
Let `AB` be bisected at `E`; let there be described on `EB` the parallelogram `BF` similar and similarly situated to `D`; and let `GH` be constructed at once equal to the sum of `BF`, `C` and similar and similarly situated to `D`. [elem.6.25]
Let `KH` correspond to `FL` and `KG` to `FE`.
Now, since `GH` is greater than `FB`, therefore `KH` is also greater than `FL`, and `KG` than `FE`.
Let `FL`, `FE` be produced, let `FLM` be equal to `KH`, and `FEN` to `KG`, and let `MN` be completed; > therefore `MN` is both equal and similar to `GH`.
But `GH` is similar to `EL`; > therefore `MN` is also similar to `EL`; [elem.6.21] therefore `EL` is about the same diameter with `MN`. [elem.6.26]
Let their diameter `FO` be drawn, and let the figure be described.
Since `GH` is equal to `EL`, `C`, while `GH` is equal to `MN`, therefore `MN` is also equal to `EL`, `C`.
Let `EL` be subtracted from each; > therefore the remainder, the gnomon `XWV`, is equal to `C`.
Now, since `AE` is equal to `EB`, > `AN` is also equal to `NB` [elem.1.36], that is, to `LP` [elem.1.43].
Let `EO` be added to each; > therefore the whole `AO` is equal to the gnomon `VWX`.
But the gnomon `VWX` is equal to `C`; > therefore `AO` is also equal to `C`.
Therefore to the given straight line `AB` there has been applied the parallelogram `AO` equal to the given rectilineal figure `C` and exceeding by a parallelogrammic figure `QP` which is similar to `D`, since `PQ` is also similar to `EL` [elem.6.24]. Q. E. F.
