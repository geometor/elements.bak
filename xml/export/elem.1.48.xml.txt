If in a triangle the square on one of the sides be equal to the squares on the remaining two sides of the triangle, the angle contained by the remaining two sides of the triangle is right.

Proof:
For in the triangle `ABC` let the square on one side `BC` be equal to the squares on the sides `BA`, `AC`;
I say that the angle `BAC` is right.
For let `AD` be drawn from the point `A` at right angles to the straight line `AC`, let `AD` be made equal to `BA`, and let `DC` be joined.
Since `DA` is equal to `AB`, the square on `DA` is also equal to the square on `AB`.
Let the square on `AC` be added to each;
But the square on `DC` is equal to the squares on `DA`, `AC`, for the angle `DAC` is right; [elem.1.47] and the square on `BC` is equal to the squares on `BA`, `AC`, for this is the hypothesis;
And, since `DA` is equal to `AB`, and `AC` is common,  and the base `DC` is equal to the base `BC`;  But the angle `DAC` is right;
Therefore etc.
