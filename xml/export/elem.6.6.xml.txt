Enunciation:
`If two triangles have one angle equal to one angle and the sides about the equal angles proportional`, `the triangles will be equiangular and will have those angles equal which the corresponding sides subtend`.

Proof:
Let `ABC`, `DEF` be two triangles having one angle `BAC` equal to one angle `EDF` and the sides about the equal angles proportional, so that, > as `BA` is to `AC`, so is `ED` to `DF`; I say that the triangle `ABC` is equiangular with the triangle `DEF`, and will have the angle `ABC` equal to the angle `DEF`, and the angle `ACB` to the angle `DFE`.
For on the straight line `DF`, and at the points `D`, `F` on it, let there be constructed the angle `FDG` equal to either of the angles `BAC`, `EDF`, and the angle `DFG` equal to the angle `ACB`; [elem.1.23] > therefore the remaining angle at `B` is equal to the remaining angle at `G`. [elem.1.32]
Therefore the triangle `ABC` is equiangular with the triangle `DGF`.
Therefore, proportionally, as `BA` is to `AC`, so is `GD` to `DF`. [elem.6.4]
But, by hypothesis, as `BA` is to `AC`, so also is `ED` to `DF`; therefore also, as `ED` is to `DF`, so is `GD` to `DF`. [elem.5.11]
Therefore `ED` is equal to `DG`; [elem.5.9] and `DF` is common; > therefore the two sides `ED`, `DF` are equal to the two sides `GD`, `DF`; and the angle `EDF` is equal to the angle `GDF`; therefore the base `EF` is equal to the base `GF`, and the triangle `DEF` is equal to the triangle `DGF`, and the remaining angles will be equal to the remaining angles, namely those which the equal sides subtend. [elem.1.4]
Therefore the angle `DFG` is equal to the angle `DFE`, > and the angle `DGF` to the angle `DEF`.
But the angle `DFG` is equal to the angle `ACB`; therefore the angle `ACB` is also equal to the angle `DFE`.
And, by hypothesis, the angle `BAC` is also equal to the angle `EDF`; therefore the remaining angle at `B` is also equal to the remaining angle at `E`; [elem.1.32] > therefore the triangle `ABC` is equiangular with the triangle `DEF`.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
