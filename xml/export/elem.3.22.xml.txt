Enunciation:
`The opposite angles of quadrilaterals in circles are equal to two right angles`.

Proof:
Let `ABCD` be a circle, and let `ABCD` be a quadrilateral in it; I say that the opposite angles are equal to two right angles.
Let `AC`, `BD` be joined.
Then, since in any triangle the three angles are equal to two right angles, [elem.1.32]
But the angle `CAB` is equal to the angle `BDC`, for they are in the same segment `BADC`; [elem.3.21] and the angle `ACB` is equal to the angle 
       `ADB`, for they are in the same segment `ADCB`; therefore the whole angle `ADC` is equal to the angles `BAC`, `ACB`.
Let the angle `ABC` be added to each; therefore the angles `ABC`, `BAC`, `ACB` are equal to the angles `ABC`, `ADC`. But the angles `ABC`, `BAC`, `ACB` are equal to two right angles; therefore the angles `ABC`, `ADC` are also equal to two right angles.
Similarly we can prove that the angles `BAD`, `DCB` are also equal to two right angles.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
