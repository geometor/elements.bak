Enunciation:
> If a number have its half odd, it is even-times odd only.

Proof:
For let the number > A have its half odd; I say that > A is even-times odd only.
Now that it is even-times odd is manifest; for the half of it, being odd, measures it an even number of times. [elem.7.def.9]
I say next that it is also even-times odd only.
For, if > A is even-times even also, it will be measured by an even number according to an even number; [elem.7.def.8] so that the half of it will also be measured by an even number though it is odd: which is absurd.
Therefore > A is even-times odd only. Q. E. D.
