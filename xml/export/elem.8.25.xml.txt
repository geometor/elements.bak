Proof:
For let the two numbers ,  have to one another the ratio which the cube number  has to the cube number , and let  be cube; I say that  is also cube.
For, since ,  are cube, ,  are similar solid numbers.
Therefore two mean proportional numbers fall between , . [elem.8.19]
And, as many numbers as fall between ,  in continued proportion, so many will also fall between those which have the same ratio with them; [elem.8.8] so that two mean proportional numbers fall between ,  also.
Let ,  so fall.
Since, then, the four numbers , , ,  are in continued proportion, and  is cube, therefore  is also cube. [elem.8.23] Q. E. D.
