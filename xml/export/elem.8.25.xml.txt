> If two numbers have to one another the ratio which a cube number has to a cube number, and the first be cube, the second will also be cube.

Proof:
For let the two numbers > A, > B have to one another the ratio which the cube number > C has to the cube number > D, and let > A be cube; I say that > B is also cube.
For, since > C, > D are cube, > C, > D are similar solid numbers.
Therefore two mean proportional numbers fall between > C, > D. [elem.8.19]
And, as many numbers as fall between > C, > D in continued proportion, so many will also fall between those which have the same ratio with them; [elem.8.8] so that two mean proportional numbers fall between > A, > B also.
Let > E, > F so fall.
Since, then, the four numbers > A, > E, > F, > B are in continued proportion, and > A is cube, therefore > B is also cube. [elem.8.23] Q. E. D.
