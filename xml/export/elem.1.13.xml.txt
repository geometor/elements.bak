Enunciation:
If a straight line set up on a straight line make angles, it will make either two right angles or angles equal to two right angles.

Proof:
For let any straight line `AB` set up on the straight line `CD` make the angles `CBA`, `ABD`;
I say that the angles `CBA`, `ABD` are either two right angles or equal to two right angles.
Now, if the angle `CBA` is equal to the angle `ABD`, > they are two right angles. [elem.1.def.10]
But, if not, let `BE` be drawn from the point `B` at right angles to `CD`; [elem.1.11] > therefore the angles `CBE`, `EBD` are two right angles.
Then, since the angle `CBE` is equal to the two angles `CBA`, `ABE`, > let the angle `EBD` be added to each; therefore the angles `CBE`, `EBD` are equal to the three angles `CBA`, `ABE`, `EBD`. [. 2]
Again, since the angle `DBA` is equal to the two angles `DBE`, `EBA`, > let the angle `ABC` be added to each; therefore the angles `DBA`. `ABC` are equal to the three angles `DBE`, `EBA`, `ABC`. [. 2]
But the angles `CBE`, `EBD` were also proved equal to the same three angles; > and things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another; [. 1] therefore the angles `CBE`, `EBD` are also equal to the angles `DBA`, `ABC`.
        But the angles `CBE`, `EBD` are two right angles; > therefore the angles `DBA`, `ABC` are also equal to two right angles.
Therefore etc.
