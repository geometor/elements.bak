Enunciation:
In any parallelogram the complements of the parallelograms about the diameter are equal to one another.

Proof:
Let `ABCD` be a parallelogram, and `AC` its diameter; and about `AC` let `EH`, `FG` be parallelograms, and `BK`, `KD`
        the so-called complements;
I say that the complement `BK` is equal to the complement `KD`.
For, since `ABCD` is a parallelogram, and `AC` its diameter, > the triangle `ABC` is equal to the triangle `ACD`. [elem.1.34]
Again, since `EH` is a parallelogram, and `AK` is its diameter, > the triangle `AEK` is equal to the triangle `AHK`.
        
        For the same reason > the triangle `KFC` is also equal to `KGC`.
Now, since the triangle `AEK` is equal to the triangle `AHK`, > and `KFC` to `KGC`,
        the triangle `AEK` together with `KGC` is equal to the triangle `AHK` together with `KFC`. [elem.1.c.n.2]
And the whole triangle `ABC` is also equal to the whole `ADC`; therefore the complement `BK` which remains is equal to the complement `KD` which remains. [elem.1.c.n.3]
Therefore etc.
