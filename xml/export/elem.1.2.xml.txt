Enunciation:
To place at a given point (as an extremity) a straight line equal to a given straight line.

Proof:
Let `A` be the given point, and `BC` the given straight line.
Thus it is required to place at the point `A` (as an extremity) a straight line equal to the given straight line `BC`.
From the point `A` to the point `B` let the straight line `AB` be joined; [elem.1.post.1] and on it let the equilateral triangle `DAB` be constructed. [elem.1.1]
Let the straight lines `AE`, `BF` be produced in a straight line with `DA`, `DB`; [elem.1.post.2] with centre `B` and distance `BC` let the circle `CGH` be described; [elem.1.post.3] and again, with centre `D` and distance `DG` let the circle `GKL` be described. [elem.1.post.3]
Then, since the point `B` is the centre of the circle `CGH`,
Again, since the point `D` is the centre of the circle `GKL`,
And in these `DA` is equal to `DB`;
But `BC` was also proved equal to `BG`;
And things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another; [elem.1.c.n.1]
Therefore at the given point `A` the straight line `AL` is placed equal to the given straight line `BC`.
