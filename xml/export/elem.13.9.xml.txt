Proof:
Let > ABC be a circle; of the figures inscribed in the circle > ABC let > BC be the side of a decagon, > CD that of a hexagon, and let them be in a straight line; I say that the whole straight line > BD has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, and > CD is its greater segment.
For let the centre of the circle, the point > E, be taken, let > EB, > EC, > ED be joined, and let > BE be carried through to > A.
Since > BC is the side of an equilateral decagon, therefore the circumference > ACB is five times the circumference > BC; therefore the circumference > AC is quadruple of > CB.
But, as the circumference > AC is to > CB, so is the angle > AEC to the angle > CEB; [elem.6.33] therefore the angle > AEC is quadruple of the angle > CEB.
And, since the angle > EBC is equal to the angle > ECB, [elem.1.5] therefore the angle > AEC is double of the angle > ECB. [elem.1.32]
And, since the straight line > EC is equal to > CD, for each of them is equal to the side of the hexagon inscribed in the circle > ABC, [elem.4.15.p.1] the angle > CED is also equal to the angle > CDE; [elem.1.5] therefore the angle > ECB is double of the angle > EDC. [elem.1.32]
But the angle > AEC was proved double of the angle > ECB; therefore the angle > AEC is quadruple of the angle > EDC.
But the angle > AEC was also proved quadruple of the angle > BEC; therefore the angle > EDC is equal to the angle > BEC.
But the angle > EBD is common to the two triangles > BEC and > BED; therefore the remaining angle > BED is also equal to the remaining angle > ECB; [elem.1.32] therefore the triangle > EBD is equiangular with the triangle > EBC.
Therefore, proportionally, as > DB is to > BE, so is > EB to > BC. [elem.6.4]
But > EB is equal to > CD.
Therefore, as > BD is to > DC, so is > DC to > CB.
And > BD is greater than > DC; therefore > DC is also greater than > CB.
Therefore the straight line > BD has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, and > DC is its greater segment. Q. E. D.
