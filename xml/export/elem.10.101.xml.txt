> The square on the straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole, if applied to a rational straight line, produces as breadth a fifth apotome.

Proof:
Let > AB be the straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole, and > CD a rational straight line, and to > CD let > CE be applied equal to the square on > AB and producing > CF as breadth; I say that > CF is a fifth apotome.
For let > BG be the annex to > AB; therefore > AG, > GB are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them medial but twice the rectangle contained by them rational. [elem.10.77]
To > CD let there be applied > CH equal to the square on > AG, and > KL equal to the square on > GB; therefore the whole > CL is equal to the squares on > AG, > GB.
But the sum of the squares on > AG, > GB together is medial; therefore > CL is medial.
And it is applied to the rational straight line > CD, producing > CM as breadth; therefore > CM is rational and incommensurable with > CD. [elem.10.22]
And, since the whole > CL is equal to the squares on > AG, > GB, and, in these, > CE is equal to the square on > AB, therefore the remainder > FL is equal to twice the rectangle > AG, > GB. [elem.2.7]
Let then > FM be bisected at > N, and through > N let > NO be drawn parallel to either of the straight lines > CD, > ML; therefore each of the rectangles > FO, > NL is equal to the rectangle > AG, > GB:
And, since twice the rectangle > AG, > GB is rational and equal to > FL, therefore > FL is rational.
And it is applied to the rational straight line > EF, producing > FM as breadth; therefore > FM is rational and commensurable in length with > CD. [elem.10.20]
Now, since > CL is medial, and > FL rational, therefore > CL is incommensurable with > FL.
But, as > CL is to > FL, so is > CM to > MF; [elem.6.1] therefore > CM is incommensurable in length with > MF. [elem.10.11]
And both are rational; therefore > CM, > MF are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore > CF is an apotome. [elem.10.73]
I say next that it is also a fifth apotome.
For we can prove similarly that the rectangle > CK, > KM is equal to the square on > NM, that is, to the fourth part of the square on > FM.
And, since the square on > AG is incommensurable with the square on > GB, while the square on > AG is equal to > CH, and the square on > GB to > KL, therefore > CH is incommensurable with > KL.
But, as > CH is to > KL, so is > CK to > KM; [elem.6.1] therefore > CK is incommensurable in length with > KM. [elem.10.11]
Since then > CM, > MF are two unequal straight lines, and a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on > FM and deficient by a square figure has been applied to > CM, and divides it into incommensurable parts, therefore the square on > CM is greater than the square on > MF by the square on a straight line incommensurable with > CM. [elem.10.18]
And the annex > FM is commensurable with the rational straight line > CD set out; therefore > CF is a fifth apotome. [elem.10.def.3.5] Q. E. D.
