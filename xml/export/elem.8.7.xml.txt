Enunciation:
> If there be as many numbers as we please in continued proportion, and the first measure the last, it will measure the second also.

Proof:
Let there be as many numbers as we please, > A, > B, > C, > D, in continued proportion; and let > A measure > D; I say that > A also measures > B.
For, if > A does not measure > B, neither will any other of the numbers measure any other. [elem.8.6]
But > A measures > D.
Therefore > A also measures > B. Q. E. D.
