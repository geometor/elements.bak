> If two straight lines meeting one another be parallel to two straight lines meeting one another not in the same plane, > they will contain equal angles.

Proof:
For let the two straight lines > AB, > BC meeting one another be parallel to the two straight lines > DE, > EF meeting one another, not in the same plane; I say that the angle > ABC is equal to the angle > DEF.
For let > BA, > BC, > ED, > EF be cut off equal to one another, and let > AD, > CF, > BE, > AC, > DF be joined.
Now, since > BA is equal and parallel to > ED, therefore > AD is also equal and parallel to > BE. [elem.1.33]
For the same reason > CF is also equal and parallel to > BE.
Therefore each of the straight lines > AD, > CF is equal and parallel to > BE.
But straight lines which are parallel to the same straight line and are not in the same plane with it are parallel to one another; [elem.11.9] therefore > AD is parallel and equal to > CF.
And > AC, > DF join them; therefore > AC is also equal and parallel to > DF. [elem.1.33]
Now, since the two sides > AB, > BC are equal to the two sides > DE, > EF, and the base > AC is equal to the base > DF, therefore the angle > ABC is equal to the angle > DEF. [elem.1.8]
Therefore etc.
