Enunciation:
Parallelograms which are on the same base and in the same parallels are equal to one another.

Proof:
Let `ABCD`, `EBCF` be parallelograms on the same base `BC` and in the same parallels `AF`, `BC`; I say that `ABCD` is equal to the parallelogram `EBCF`.
For, since `ABCD` is a parallelogram, > `AD` is equal to `BC`. [elem.1.34]
For the same reason also > `EF` is equal to `BC`, so that `AD` is also equal to `EF`; [elem.1.c.n.1] and `DE` is common; > therefore the whole `AE` is equal to the whole `DF`. [elem.1.c.n.2]
But `AB` is also equal to `DC`; [elem.1.34] therefore the two sides `EA`, `AB` are equal to the two sides `FD`, `DC` respectively, 
        > and the angle `FDC` is equal to the angle `EAB`, the exterior to the interior; [elem.1.29] therefore the base `EB` is equal to the base `FC`, and the triangle `EAB` will be equal to the triangle `FDC`. [elem.1.4]
Let `DGE` be subtracted from each; therefore the trapezium `ABGD` which remains is equal to the trapezium `EGCF` which remains. [elem.1.c.n.3]
Let the triangle `GBC` be added to each; therefore the whole parallelogram `ABCD` is equal to the whole parallelogram `EBCF`. [elem.1.c.n.2]
Therefore etc.
