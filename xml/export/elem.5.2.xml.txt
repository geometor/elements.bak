`If a first magnitude be the same multiple of a second that a third is of a fourth`, `and a fifth also be the same multiple of the second that a sixth is of the fourth`, `the sum of the first and fifth will also be the same multiple of the second that the sum of the third and sixth is of the fourth`.

Proof:
Let a first magnitude, `AB`, be the same multiple of a second, `C`, that a third, `DE`, is of a fourth, `F`, and let a fifth, `BG`, also be the same multiple of the second, `C`, that a sixth, `EH`, is of the fourth `F`; `AG`, will be the same multiple of the second, `C`, that the sum of the third and sixth, `DH`, is of the fourth, `F`.
For, since `AB` is the same multiple of `C` that `DE` is of `F`, therefore, as many magnitudes as there are in `AB` equal to `C`, so many also are there in `DE` equal to `F`.
For the same reason also, as many as there are in `BG` equal to `C`, so many are there also in `EH` equal to `F`; `AG` equal to `C`, so many also are there in the whole `DH` equal to `F`.
Therefore, whatever multiple `AG` is of `C`, that multiple also is `DH` of `F`.
Therefore the sum of the first and fifth, `AG`, is the same multiple of the second, `C`, that the sum of the third and sixth, `DH`, is of the fourth, `F`.
Therefore etc. Q.E.D.
