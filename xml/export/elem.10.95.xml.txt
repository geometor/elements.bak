> If an area be contained by a rational straight line and a fifth apotome, the 
 of the area is a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole.

Proof:
For let the area > AB be contained by the rational straight line > AC and the fifth apotome > AD; I say that the 
 of the area > AB is a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole.
For let > DG be the annex to > AD; therefore > AG, > GD are rational straight lines commensurable in square only,  the annex > GD is commensurable in length with the rational straight line > AC set out, and the square on the whole > AG is greater than the square on the annex > DG by the square on a straight line incommensurable with > AG. [elem.10.def.3.5]
Therefore, if there be applied to > AG a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on > DG and deficient by a square figure, it will divide it into incommensurable parts. [elem.10.18]
Let then > DG be bisected at the point > E, let there be applied to > AG a parallelogram equal to the square on > EG and deficient by a square figure, and let it be the rectangle > AF, > FG; therefore > AF is incommensurable in length with > FG.
Now, since > AG is incommensurable in length with > CA, and both are rational, therefore > AK is medial. [elem.10.21]
Again, since > DG is rational and commensurable in length with > AC, > DK is rational. [elem.10.19]
Now let the square > LM be constructed equal to > AI, and let the square > NO equal to > FK and about the same angle, the angle > LPM, be subtracted; therefore the squares > LM, > NO are about the same diameter. [elem.6.26]
Let > PR be their diameter, and let the figure be drawn.
Similarly then we can prove that > LN is the 
 of the area > AB.
I say that > LN is the straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole.
For, since > AK was proved medial and is equal to the squares on > LP, > PN, therefore the sum of the squares on > LP, > PN is medial.
Again, since > DK is rational and is equal to twice the rectangle > LP, > PN, the latter is itself also rational.
And, since > AI is incommensurable with > FK, therefore the square on > LP is also incommensurable with the square on > PN; therefore > LP, > PN are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them medial but twice the rectangle contained by them rational.
Therefore the remainder > LN is the irrational straight line called that which produces with a rational area a medial whole; [elem.10.77] and it is the 
 of the area > AB.
Therefore the 
 of the area > AB is a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole. Q. E. D.
