Enunciation:
> If there be two prisms of equal height, > and one have a parallelogram as base and the other a triangle, > and if the parallelogram be double of the triangle, > the prisms will be equal.

Proof:
Let > ABCDEF, > GHKLMN be two prisms of equal height, let one have the parallelogram > AF as base, and the other the triangle > GHK, and let the parallelogram > AF be double of the triangle > GHK; I say that the prism > ABCDEF is equal to the prism > GHKLMN.
For let the solids > AO, > GP be completed.
Since the parallelogram > AF is double of the triangle > GHK, while the parallelogram > HK is also double of the triangle > GHK, [elem.1.34] therefore the parallelogram > AF is equal to the parallelogram > HK.
But parallelepipedal solids which are on equal bases and of the same height are equal to one another; [elem.11.31] therefore the solid > AO is equal to the solid > GP.
And the prism > ABCDEF is half of the solid > AO, and the prism > GHKLMN is half of the solid > GP; [elem.11.28] therefore the prism > ABCDEF is equal to the prism > GHKLMN.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
