Enunciation:
> If a parallelepipedal solid be cut by a plane through the diagonals of the opposite planes, > the solid will be bisected by the plane.

Proof:
For let the parallelepipedal solid > AB be cut by the plane > CDEF through the diagonals > CF, > DE of opposite planes; I say that the solid > AB will be bisected by the plane > CDEF.
For, since the triangle > CGF is equal to the triangle > CFB, [elem.1.34] and > ADE to > DEH, while the parallelogram > CA is also equal to the parallelogram > EB, for they are opposite, and > GE to > CH, therefore the prism contained by the two triangles > CGF, > ADE and the three parallelograms > GE, > AC, > CE is also equal to the prism contained by the two triangles > CFB, > DEH and the three parallelograms > CH, > BE, > CE; for they are contained by planes equal both in multitude and in magnitude. [elem.11.def.10]
Hence the whole solid > AB is bisected by the plane > CDEF. Q. E. D.
