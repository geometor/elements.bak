Enunciation:
In any triangle the greater side subtends the greater angle.

Proof:
For let `ABC` be a triangle having the side `AC` greater than `AB`;
I say that the angle `ABC` is also greater than the angle `BCA`.
For, since `AC` is greater than `AB`, let `AD` be made equal to `AB` [elem.1.3], and let `BD` bejoined.
Then, since the angle `ADB` is an exterior angle of the triangle `BCD`,
it is greater than the interior and opposite angle `DCB`. [elem.1.16]
But the angle `ADB` is equal to the angle `ABD`, > since the side `AB` is equal to `AD`; therefore the angle `ABD` is also greater than the angle `ACB`; therefore the angle `ABC` is much greater than the angle `ACB`.
Therefore etc.
