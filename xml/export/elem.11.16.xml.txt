Enunciation:
> If two parallel planes be cut by any plane, > their common sections are parallel.

Proof:
For let the two parallel planes > AB, > CD be cut by the plane > EFGH, and let > EF, > GH be their common sections; I say that > EF is parallel to > GH.
For, if not, > EF, > GH will, when produced, meet either in the direction of > F, > H or of > E, > G.
Let them be produced, as in the direction of > F, > H, and let them, first, meet at > K.
Now, since > EFK is in the plane > AB, therefore all the points on > EFK are also in the plane > AB. [elem.11.1]
But > K is one of the points on the straight line > EFK; therefore > K is in the plane > AB.
For the same reason > K is also in the plane > CD; therefore the planes > AB, > CD will meet when produced.
But they do not meet, because they are, by hypothesis, parallel; therefore the straight lines > EF, > GH will not meet when produced in the direction of > F, > H.
Similarly we can prove that neither will the straight lines > EF, > GH meet when produced in the direction of > E, > G.
But straight lines which do not meet in either direction are parallel. [elem.1.def.23]
Therefore > EF is parallel to > GH.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
