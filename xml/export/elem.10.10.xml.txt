Enunciation:
> To find two straight lines incommensurable, the one in length only, and the other in square also, with an assigned straight line.

Proof:
Let > A be the assigned straight line; thus it is required to find two straight lines incommensurable, the one in length only, and the other in square also, with > A.
Let two numbers > B, > C be set out which have not to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number, that is, which are not similar plane numbers; and let it be contrived that, > as > B is to > C, so is the square on > A to the square on > D
        —for we have learnt how to do this— [elem.10.6.p.1] therefore the square on > A is commensurable with the square on > D. [elem.10.6]
And, since > B has not to > C the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore neither has the square on > A to the square on > D the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore > A is incommensurable in length with > D. [elem.10.9]
Let > E be taken a mean proportional between > A, > D; therefore, as > A is to > D, so is the square on > A to the square on > E. [elem.5.def.9]
But > A is incommensurable in length with > D; therefore the square on > A is also incommensurable with the square on > E; [elem.10.11] therefore > A is incommensurable in square with > E.
Therefore two straight lines > D, > E have been found incommensurable, > D in length only, and > E in square and of course in length also, with the assigned straight line > A.]
