Enunciation:
If a parallelogram have the same base with a triangle and be in the same parallels, the parallelogram is double of the triangle.

Proof:
For let the parallelogram `ABCD` have the same base `BC` with the triangle `EBC`, and let it be in the same parallels `BC`, `AE`;
I say that the parallelogram `ABCD` is double of the triangle `BEC`.
For let `AC` be joined.
Then the triangle `ABC` is equal to the triangle `EBC`; for it is on the same base `BC` with it and in the same parallels `BC`, `AE`. [elem.1.37]
But the parallelogram `ABCD` is double of the triangle `ABC`; > for the diameter `AC` bisects it; [elem.1.34] so that the parallelogram `ABCD` is also double of the triangle `EBC`.
Therefore etc.
