Enunciation:
> Given two numbers, to find the least number which they measure.

Proof:
Let > A, > B be the two given numbers; thus it is required to find the least number which they measure.
Now > A, > B are either prime to one another or not.
First, let > A, > B be prime to one another, and let > A by multiplying > B make > C; therefore also > B by multiplying > A has made > C. [elem.7.16]
Therefore > A, > B measure > C
I say next that it is also the least number they measure.
For, if not, > A, > B will measure some number which is less than > C.
Let them measure > D.
Then, as many times as > A measures > D, so many units let there be in > E, and, as many times as > B measures > D, so many units let there be in > F; therefore > A by multiplying > E has made > D, and > B by multiplying > F has made > D; [elem.7.def.15] therefore the product of > A, > E is equal to the product of > B, > F.
Therefore, as > A is to > B, so is > F
       > E. [elem.7.19]
But > A, > B are prime, primes are also least, [elem.7.21] and the least measure the numbers which have the same ratio the same number of times, the greater the greater and the less the less; [elem.7.20] therefore > B measures > E, as consequent consequent.
And, since > A by multiplying > B, > E has made > C, > D, therefore, as > B is to > E, so is > C to > D. [elem.7.17]
But > B measures > E; therefore > C also measures > D, the greater the less: which is impossible.
Therefore > A, > B do not measure any number less than > C; therefore > C is the least that is measured by > A, > B.
Next, let > A, > B not be prime to one another, and let > F, > E, the least numbers of those which have the same ratio with > A, > B, be taken; [elem.7.33] therefore the product of > A, > E is equal to the product of > B, > F. [elem.7.19]
And let > A by multiplying > E make > C; therefore also > B by multiplying > F has made > C; therefore > A, > B measure > C.
I say next that it is also the least number that they measure.
For, if not, > A, > B will measure some number which is less than > C.
Let them measure > D.
And, as many times as > A measures > D, so many units let there be in > G, and, as many times as > B measures > D, so many units let there be in > H.
Therefore > A by multiplying > G has made > D, and > B by multiplying > H has made > D.
Therefore the product of > A, > G is equal to the product of > B, > H; therefore, as > A is to > B, so is > H to > G. [elem.7.19]
But, as > A is to > B, so is > F to > E.
Therefore also, as > F is to > E, so is > H to > G.
But > F, > E are least, and the least measure the numbers which have the same ratio the same number of times, the greater the greater and the less the less; [elem.7.20] therefore > E measures > G.
And, since > A by multiplying > E, > G has made > C, > D, therefore, as > E is to > G, so is > C to > D. [elem.7.17]
But > E measures > G; therefore > C also measures > D, the greater the less: which is impossible.
Therefore > A, > B will not measure any number which is less than > C.
Therefore > C is the least that is measured by > A, > B. Q. E. D.
