Enunciation:
> If an odd number measure an even number, it will also measure the half of it.

Proof:
For let the odd number > A measure the even number > B; I say that it will also measure the half of it.
For, since > A measures > B, let it measure it according to > C; I say that > C is not odd.
For, if possible, let it be so.
Then, since > A measures > B according to > C, therefore > A by multiplying > C has made > B.
Therefore > B is made up of odd numbers the multitude of which is odd.
Therefore > B is odd: [elem.9.23] which is absurd, for by hypothesis it is even.
Therefore > C is not odd; therefore > C is even.
Thus > A measures > B an even number of times.
For this reason then it also measures the half of it. Q. E. D.
