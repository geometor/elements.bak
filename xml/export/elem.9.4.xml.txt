> If a cube number by multiplying a cube number make some number, the product will be cube.

Proof:
For let the cube number > A by multiplying the cube number > B make > C; I say that > C is cube.
For let > A by multiplying itself make > D; therefore > D is cube. [elem.9.3]
And, since > A by multiplying itself has made > D, and by multiplying > B has made > C therefore, as > A is to > B, so is > D to > C. [elem.7.17]
And, since > A, > B are cube numbers, > A, > B are similar solid numbers.
Therefore two mean proportional numbers fall between > A, > B; [elem.8.19] so that two mean proportional numbers will fall between > D, > C also. [elem.8.8]
And > D is cube; therefore > C is also cube [elem.8.23] Q. E. D.
