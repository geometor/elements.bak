> Planes to which the same straight line is at right angles will be parallel.

Proof:
For let any straight line > AB be at right angles to each of the planes > CD, > EF; I say that the planes are parallel.
For, if not, they will meet when produced.
Let them meet; they will then make, as common section, a straight line. [elem.11.3]
Let them make > GH; let a point > K be taken at random on > GH, and let > AK, > BK be joined.
Now, since > AB is at right angles to the plane > EF, therefore > AB is also at right angles to > BK which is a straight line in the plane > EF produced; [elem.11.def.3] therefore the angle > ABK is right.
For the same reason the angle > BAK is also right.
Thus, in the triangle > ABK, the two angles > ABK, > BAK are equal to two right angles: which is impossible. [elem.1.17]
Therefore the planes > CD, > EF will not meet when produced; therefore the planes > CD, > EF are parallel. [elem.11.def.8]
Therefore planes to which the same straight line is at right angles are parallel. Q. E. D.
