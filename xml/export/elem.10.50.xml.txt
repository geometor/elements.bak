> To find the third binomial straight line.

Proof:
Let two numbers > AC, > CB be set out such that the sum of them > AB has to > BC the ratio which a square number has to a square number, but has not to > AC the ratio which a square number has to a square number.
Let any other number > D, not square, be set out also, and let it not have to either of the numbers > BA. > AC the ratio which a square number has to a square number.
Let any rational straight line > E be set out, and let it be contrived that, as > D is to > AB, so is the square on > E to the square on > FG; [elem.10.6.p.1] therefore the square on > E is commensurable with the square on > FG. [elem.10.6]
And > E is rational; therefore > FG is also rational.
And, since > D has not to > AB the ratio which a square number has to a square number, neither has the square on > E to the square on > FG the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore > E is incommensurable in length with > FG. [elem.10.9]
Next let it be contrived that, as the number > BA is to > AC, so is the square on > FG to the square on > GH; [elem.10.6.p.1] therefore the square on > FG is commensurable with the square on > GH. [elem.10.6]
But > FG is rational; therefore > GH is also rational.
And, since > BA has not to > AC the ratio which a square number has to a square number, neither has the square on > FG to the square on > HG the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore > FG is incommensurable in length with > GH. [elem.10.9]
Therefore > FG, > GH are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore > FH is binomial. [elem.10.36]
I say next that it is also a third binomial straight line.
For since, as > D is to > AB, so is the square on > E to the square on > FG, and, as > BA is to > AC, so is the square on > FG to the square on > GH, therefore, , as > D is to > AC, so is the square on > E to the square on > GH. [elem.5.22]
But > D has not to > AC the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore neither has the square on > E to the square on > GH the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore > E is incommensurable in length with > GH. [elem.10.9]
And since, as > BA is to > AC, so is the square on > FG to the square on > GH, therefore the square on > FG is greater than the square on > GH.
Let then the squares on > GH, > K be equal to the square on > FG; therefore, , as > AB is to > BC, so is the square on > FG to the square on > K. [elem.5.19.p.1]
But > AB has to > BC the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore the square on > FG also has to the square on > K the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore > FG is commensurable in length with > K. [elem.10.9]
Therefore the square on > FG is greater than the square on > GH by the square on a straight line commensurable with > FG.
And > FG, > GH are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, and neither of them is commensurable in length with > E.
Therefore > FH is a third binomial straight line. Q. E. D.
