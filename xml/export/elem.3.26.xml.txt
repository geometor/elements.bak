Enunciation:
`In equal circles equal angles stand on equal circumferences`, `whether they stand at the centres or at the circumferences`.

Proof:
Let `ABC`, `DEF` be equal circles, and in them let there be equal angles, namely at the centres the angles `BGC`, `EHF`, and at the circumferences the angles `BAC`, `EDF`; I say that the circumference `BKC` is equal to the circumference `ELF`.
For let `BC`, `EF` be joined.
Now, since the circles `ABC`, `DEF` are equal, > the radii are equal.
Thus the two straight lines `BG`, `GC` are equal to the two straight lines `EH`, `HF`; > and the angle at `G` is equal to the angle at `H`; therefore the base `BC` is equal to the base `EF`. [elem.1.4]
And, since the angle at `A` is equal to the angle at `D`, > the segment `BAC` is similar to the segment `EDF`; [elem.3.def.11] and they are upon equal straight lines.
But similar segments of circles on equal straight lines are equal to one another; [elem.3.24] > therefore the segment `BAC` is equal to `EDF`. But the whole circle `ABC` is also equal to the whole circle `DEF`; therefore the circumference `BKC` which remains is equal to the circumference `ELF`.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
