Proof:
Let , , , three numbers in continued proportion, be the least of those which have the same ratio with them; I say that any two of the numbers , ,  whatever added together are prime to the remaining number, namely ,  to ; ,  to ; and further ,  to .
For let two numbers , , the least of those which have the same ratio with , , , be taken. [elem.8.2]
It is then manifest that  by multiplying itself has made , and by multiplying  has made , and, further,  by multiplying itself has made . [elem.8.2]
Now, since ,  are least, they are prime to one another. [elem.7.22]
But, if two numbers be prime to one another, their sum is also prime to each; [elem.7.28] therefore  is also prime to each of the numbers , .
But further  is also prime to ; therefore ,  are prime to .
But, if two numbers be prime to any number, their product is also prime to the other; [elem.7.24] so that the product of ,  is prime to ; hence the product of ,  is also prime to the square on . [elem.7.25]
But the product of ,  is the square on  together with the product of , ; [elem.2.3] therefore the square on  together with the product of ,  is prime to the square on .
And the square on  is , the product of ,  is , and the square on  is ; therefore ,  added together are prime to .
Similarly we can prove that ,  added together are prime to .
I say next that ,  added together are also prime to .
For, since  is prime to each of the numbers , , the square on  is also prime to the product of , . [elem.7.24 elem.7.25]
But the squares on ,  together with twice the product of ,  are equal to the square on ; [elem.2.4] therefore the squares on ,  together with twice the product of ,  are prime to the product of , .
, the squares on ,  together with once the product of ,  are prime to the product of , .
Therefore,  again, the squares on ,  are prime to the product of , .
And the square on  is , the product of ,  is , and the square on  is .
Therefore ,  added together are prime to . Q. E. D.
