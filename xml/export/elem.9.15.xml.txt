> If three numbers in continued proportion be the least of those which have the same ratio with them, any two whatever added together will be prime to the remaining number.

Proof:
Let > A, > B, > C, three numbers in continued proportion, be the least of those which have the same ratio with them; I say that any two of the numbers > A, > B, > C whatever added together are prime to the remaining number, namely > A, > B to > C; > B, > C to > A; and further > A, > C to > B.
For let two numbers > DE, > EF, the least of those which have the same ratio with > A, > B, > C, be taken. [elem.8.2]
It is then manifest that > DE by multiplying itself has made > A, and by multiplying > EF has made > B, and, further, > EF by multiplying itself has made > C. [elem.8.2]
Now, since > DE, > EF are least, they are prime to one another. [elem.7.22]
But, if two numbers be prime to one another, their sum is also prime to each; [elem.7.28] therefore > DF is also prime to each of the numbers > DE, > EF.
But further > DE is also prime to > EF; therefore > DF, > DE are prime to > EF.
But, if two numbers be prime to any number, their product is also prime to the other; [elem.7.24] so that the product of > FD, > DE is prime to > EF; hence the product of > FD, > DE is also prime to the square on > EF. [elem.7.25]
But the product of > FD, > DE is the square on > DE together with the product of > DE, > EF; [elem.2.3] therefore the square on > DE together with the product of > DE, > EF is prime to the square on > EF.
And the square on > DE is > A, the product of > DE, > EF is > B, and the square on > EF is > C; therefore > A, > B added together are prime to > C.
Similarly we can prove that > B, > C added together are prime to > A.
I say next that > A, > C added together are also prime to > B.
For, since > DF is prime to each of the numbers > DE, > EF, the square on > DF is also prime to the product of > DE, > EF. [elem.7.24 elem.7.25]
But the squares on > DE, > EF together with twice the product of > DE, > EF are equal to the square on > DF; [elem.2.4] therefore the squares on > DE, > EF together with twice the product of > DE, > EF are prime to the product of > DE, > EF.
, the squares on > DE, > EF together with once the product of > DE, > EF are prime to the product of > DE, > EF.
Therefore,  again, the squares on > DE, > EF are prime to the product of > DE, > EF.
And the square on > DE is > A, the product of > DE, > EF is > B, and the square on > EF is > C.
Therefore > A, > C added together are prime to > B. Q. E. D.
