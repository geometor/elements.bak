But  is also rational; therefore  is commensurable with .
And, as  is to , so is  to . [elem.6.1]
Therefore  is also commensurable with ; [elem.10.11] and  is equal to ; therefore  is also commensurable with .
But  is rational; therefore  is also rational and commensurable in length with .
Therefore etc.
