Enunciation:
> If a rational area be applied to a rational straight line, it produces as breadth a straight line rational and commensurable in length with the straight line to which it is applied.

Proof:
For let the rational area > AC be applied to > AB, a straight line once more rational in any of the aforesaid ways, producing > BC as breadth; I say that > BC is rational and commensurable in length with > BA. For on > AB let the square > AD be described; therefore > AD is rational. [elem.10.def.4]
But > AC is also rational; therefore > DA is commensurable with > AC.
And, as > DA is to > AC, so is > DB to > BC. [elem.6.1]
Therefore > DB is also commensurable with > BC; [elem.10.11] and > DB is equal to > BA; therefore > AB is also commensurable with > BC.
But > AB is rational; therefore > BC is also rational and commensurable in length with > AB.
Therefore etc.
