Enunciation:
> Given three commensurable magnitudes, > to find their greatest common measure.

Proof:
Let > A, > B, > C be the three given commensurable magnitudes; thus it is required to find the greatest common measure of > A, > B, > C.
Let the greatest common measure of the two magnitudes > A, > B be taken, and let it be > D; [elem.10.3] then > D either measures > C, or does not measure it.
First, let it measure it.
Since then > D measures > C, while it also measures > A, > B, therefore > D is a common measure of > A, > B, > C.
And it is manifest that it is also the greatest; for a greater magnitude than the magnitude > D does not measure > A, > B.
Next, let > D not measure > C.
I say first that > C, > D are commensurable.
For, since > A, > B, > C are commensurable, some magnitude will measure them, and this will of course measure > A, > B also; so that it will also measure the greatest common measure of > A, > B, namely > D. [elem.10.3.p.1]
But it also measures > C; so that the said magnitude will measure > C, > D; therefore > C, > D are commensurable.
Now let their greatest common measure be taken, and let it be > E. [elem.10.3]
Since then > E measures > D, while > D measures > A, > B, therefore > E will also measure > A, > B.
But it measures > C also; therefore > E measures > A, > B, > C; therefore > E is a common measure of > A, > B, > C.
I say next that it is also the greatest.
For, if possible, let there be some magnitude > F greater than > E, and let it measure > A, > B, > C.
Now, since > F measures > A, > B, > C, it will also measure > A, > B, and will measure the greatest common measure of > A, > B. [elem.10.3.p.1]
But the greatest common measure of > A, > B is > D; therefore > F measures > D.
But it measures > C also; therefore > F measures > C, > D; therefore > F will also measure the greatest common measure of > C, > D. [elem.10.3.p.1]
But that is > E; therefore > F will measure > E, the greater the less: which is impossible.
Therefore no magnitude greater than the magnitude > E will measure > A, > B, > C; therefore > E is the greatest common measure of > A, > B, > C if > D do not measure > C, and, if it measure it, > D is itself the greatest common measure.
Therefore the greatest common measure of the three given commensurable magnitudes has been found.
