Enunciation:
> If two numbers be prime to one another, the product of one of them into itself will be prime to the remaining one.

Proof:
Let > A, > B be two numbers prime to one another, and let > A by multiplying itself make > C: I say that > B, > C are prime to one another.
For let > D be made equal to > A.
Since > A, > B are prime to one another, and > A is equal to > D, therefore > D, > B are also prime to one another.
Therefore each of the two numbers > D, > A is prime to > B; therefore the product of > D, > A will also be prime to > B. [elem.7.24]
But the number which is the product of > D, > A is > C.
Therefore > C, > B are prime to one another. Q. E. D.
