> A straight line commensurable in length with an apotome is an apotome and the same in order.

Proof:
Let > AB be an apotome, and let > CD be commensurable in length with > AB;  I say that > CD is also an apotome and the same in order with > AB.
For, since > AB is an apotome, let > BE be the annex to it; therefore > AE, > EB are rational straight lines commensurable in square only. [elem.10.73]
Let it be contrived that the ratio of > BE to > DF is the same as the ratio of > AB to > CD; [elem.6.12] therefore also, as one is to one, so are all to all; [elem.5.12] therefore also, as the whole > AE is to the whole > CF, so is > AB to > CD.
But > AB is commensurable in length with > CD.
Therefore > AE is also commensurable with > CF, and > BE with > DF. [elem.10.11]
And > AE, > EB are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore > CF, > FD are also rational straight lines commensurable in square only. [elem.10.13]
Now since, as > AE is to > CF, so is > BE to > DF, alternately therefore, as > AE is to > EB, so is > CF to > FD. [elem.5.16]
And the square on > AE is greater than the square on > EB either by the square on a straight line commensurable with > AE or by the square on a straight line incommensurable with it.
If then the square on > AE is greater than the square on > EB by the square on a straight line commensurable with > AE, the square on > CF will also be greater than the square on > FD by the square on a straight line commensurable with > CF. [elem.10.14]
And, if > AE is commensurable in length with the rational straight line set out, > CF is so also, [elem.10.12] if > BE, then > DF also, [id.] and, if neither of the straight lines > AE, > EB, then neither of the straight lines > CF, > FD. [elem.10.13]
But, if the square on > AE is greater than the square on > EB by the square on a straight line incommensurable with > AE, the square on > CF will also be greater than the square on > FD by the square on a straight line incommensurable with > CF. [elem.10.14]
And, if > AE is commensurable in length with the rational straight line set out, > CF is so also, if > BE, then > DF also, [elem.10.12] and, if neither of the straight lines > AE, > EB, then neither of the straight lines > CF, > FD. [elem.10.13]
Therefore > CD is an apotome and the same in order with > AB. Q. E. D.
