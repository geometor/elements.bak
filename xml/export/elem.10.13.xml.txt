Enunciation:
> If two magnitudes be commensurable, and the one of them be incommensurable with any magnitude, the remaining one will also be incommensurable with the same.

Proof:
Let > A, > B be two commensurable magnitudes, and let one of them, > A, be incommensurable with any other magnitude > C; I say that the remaining one, > B, will also be incommensurable with > C.
For, if > B is commensurable with > C, while > A is also commensurable with > B, > A is also commensurable with > C. [elem.10.12]
But it is also incommensurable with it: which is impossible.
Therefore > B is not commensurable with > C; therefore it is incommensurable with it.
Therefore etc.
