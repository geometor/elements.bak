> The side of the sum of two medial areas is divided at one point only.

Proof:
Let > AB be divided at > C, so that > AC, > CB are incommensurable in square and make the sum of the squares on > AC, > CB medial, and the rectangle > AC, > CB medial and also incommensurable with the sum of the squares on them; I say that > AB is not divided at another point so as to fulfil the given conditions.
For, if possible, let it be divided at > D, so that again > AC is of course not the same as > BD, but > AC is supposed greater; let a rational straight line > EF be set out, and let there be applied to > EF the rectangle > EG equal to the squares on > AC, > CB, and the rectangle > HK equal to twice the rectangle > AC, > CB; therefore the whole > EK is equal to the square on > AB. [elem.2.4
]
Again, let > EL, equal to the squares on > AD, > DB, be applied to > EF; therefore the remainder, twice the rectangle > AD, > DB, is equal to the remainder > MK.
And since, by hypothesis, the sum of the squares on > AC, > CB is medial, therefore > EG is also medial.
And it is applied to the rational straight line > EF; therefore > HE is rational and incommensurable in length with > EF. [elem.10.22
]
For the same reason > HN is also rational and incommensurable in length with > EF.
And, since the sum of the squares on > AC, > CB is incommensurable with twice the rectangle > AC, > CB, therefore > EG is also incommensurable with > GN, so that > EH is also incommensurable with > HN. [elem.6.1
, elem.10.11
]
And they are rational; therefore > EH, > HN are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore > EN is a binomial straight line divided at > H. [elem.10.36
]
Similarly we can prove that it is also divided at > M.
And > EH is not the same with > MN; therefore a binomial has been divided at different points: which is absurd. [elem.10.42
]
Therefore a side of the sum of two medial areas is not divided at different points; therefore it is divided at one point only.
