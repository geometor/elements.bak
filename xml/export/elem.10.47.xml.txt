Proof:
Let  be divided at , so that ,  are incommensurable in square and make the sum of the squares on ,  medial, and the rectangle ,  medial and also incommensurable with the sum of the squares on them; I say that  is not divided at another point so as to fulfil the given conditions.
For, if possible, let it be divided at , so that again  is of course not the same as , but  is supposed greater; let a rational straight line  be set out, and let there be applied to  the rectangle  equal to the squares on , , and the rectangle  equal to twice the rectangle , ; therefore the whole  is equal to the square on . [elem.2.4
]
Again, let , equal to the squares on , , be applied to ; therefore the remainder, twice the rectangle , , is equal to the remainder .
And since, by hypothesis, the sum of the squares on ,  is medial, therefore  is also medial.
And it is applied to the rational straight line ; therefore  is rational and incommensurable in length with . [elem.10.22
]
For the same reason  is also rational and incommensurable in length with .
And, since the sum of the squares on ,  is incommensurable with twice the rectangle , , therefore  is also incommensurable with , so that  is also incommensurable with . [elem.6.1
, elem.10.11
]
And they are rational; ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore  is a binomial straight line divided at . [elem.10.36
]
Similarly we can prove that it is also divided at
And  is not the same with ; therefore a binomial has been divided at different points: which is absurd. [elem.10.42
]
Therefore a side of the sum of two medial areas is not divided at different points; therefore it is divided at one point only.
