Proof:
For let the rectangle  be contained by the medial straight lines ,  which are commensurable in square only; I say that  is either rational or medial.
For on ,  let the squares ,  be described; therefore each of the squares ,  is medial.
Let a rational straight line  be set out, to  let there be applied the rectangular parallelogram  equal to , producing  as breadth, to  let there be applied the rectangular parallelogram  equal to , producing  as breadth, and further to  let there be similarly applied  equal to , producing  as breadth; therefore , ,  are in a straight line.
Since then each of the squares ,  is medial, and  is equal to , and  to , therefore each of the rectangles ,  is also medial.
And they are applied to the rational straight line ; therefore each of the straight lines ,  is rational and incommensurable in length with . [elem.10.22]
And, since  is commensurable with , therefore  is also commensurable with .
And, as  is to , so is  to ; [elem.6.1] therefore  is commensurable in length with . [elem.10.11]
Therefore ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in length; therefore the rectangle ,  is rational. [elem.10.19]
And, since  is equal to , and  to , therefore, as  is to , so is  to .
But, as  is to , so is  to , [elem.6.1] and, as  is to , so is  to ; [.] therefore, as  is to , so is  to .
But  is equal to ,  to  and  to ; therefore, as  is to , so is  to ; therefore also, as  is to , so is  to ; [elem.6.1, elem.5.11] therefore the rectangle ,  is equal to the square on . [elem.6.17]
But the rectangle ,  is rational; therefore the square on  is also rational.
Therefore  is rational.
And, if it is commensurable in length with ,  is rational; [elem.10.19] but, if it is incommensurable in length with , ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, and therefore  is medial. [elem.10.21]
Therefore  is either rational or medial.
But  is equal to ; therefore  is either rational or medial.
Therefore etc.
