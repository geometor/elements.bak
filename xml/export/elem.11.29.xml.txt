Enunciation:
> Parallelepipedal solids which are on the same base and of the same height, > and in which the extremities of the sides which stand up are on the same straight lines, > are equal to one another.

Proof:
Let > CM, > CN be parallelepipedal solids on the same base > AB and of the same height, and let the extremities of their sides which stand up, namely > AG, > AF, > LM, > LN, > CD, > CE, > BH, > BK, be on the same straight lines > FN, > DK; I say that the solid > CM is equal to the solid > CN.
For, since each of the figures > CH, > CK is a parallelogram, > CB is equal to each of the straight lines > DH, > EK, [elem.1.34] hence > DH is also equal to > EK.
Let > EH be subtracted from each; therefore the remainder > DE is equal to the remainder > HK.
Hence the triangle > DCE is also equal to the triangle > HBK, [elem.1.8 elem.1.4] and the parallelogram > DG to the parallelogram > HN. [elem.1.36]
For the same reason the triangle > AFG is also equal to the triangle > MLN.
But the parallelogram > CF is equal to the parallelogram > BM, and > CG to > BN, for they are opposite; therefore the prism contained by the two triangles > AFG, > DCE and the three parallelograms > AD, > DG, > CG is equal to the prism contained by the two triangles > MLN, > HBK and the three parallelograms > BM, > HN, > BN.
Let there be added to each the solid of which the parallelogram > AB is the base and > GEHM its opposite; therefore the whole parallelepipedal solid > CM is equal to the whole parallelepipedal solid > CN.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
