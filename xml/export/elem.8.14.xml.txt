Enunciation:
> If a square measure a square, the side will also measure the side; and, if the side measure the side, the square will also measure the square.

Proof:
Let > A, > B be square numbers, let > C, > D be their sides, and let > A measure > B; I say that > C also measures > D.
For let > C by multiplying > D make > E; therefore > A, > E, > B are continuously proportional in the ratio of > C to > D. [elem.8.11]
And, since > A, > E, > B are continuously proportional, and > A measures > B, therefore > A also measures > E. [elem.8.7]
And, as > A is to > E, so is > C to > D; therefore also > C measures > D. [elem.7.def.20]
Again, let > C measure > D; I say that > A also measures > B.
For, with the same construction, we can in a similar manner prove that > A, > E, > B are continuously proportional in the ratio of > C to > D.
And since, as > C is to > D, so is > A to > E, and > C measures > D, therefore > A also measures > E. [elem.7.def.20]
And > A, > E, > B are continuously proportional; therefore > A also measures > B.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
