Proof:
Let a rational straight line  be set out, and let  be commensurable in length with ; therefore  is also rational.
Let two square numbers ,  be set out, and let their difference  not be square; therefore neither has  to  the ratio which a square number has to a square number.
Let it be contrived that, as  is to , so is the square on  to the square on ; [elem.10.6.p.1] therefore the square on  is commensurable with the square on . [elem.10.6]
But the square on  is rational; therefore the square on  is also rational; therefore  is also rational.
And, since  has not to  the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore neither has the square on  to the square on  the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore  is incommensurable in length with . [elem.10.9]
And both are rational; therefore ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore  is an apotome. [elem.10.73]
I say next that it is also a first apotome.
For let the square on  be that by which the square on  is greater than the square on .
Now since. as  is to , so is the square on  to the square on , therefore also, , [elem.5.19.p.1] as  is to , so is the square on  to the square on .
But  has to  the ratio which a square number has to a square number, for each is square; therefore the square on  also has to the square on  the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore  is commensurable in length with . [elem.10.9]
And the square on  is greater than the square on  by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with .
And the whole  is commensurable in length with the rational straight line  set out.
Therefore  is a first apotome. [elem.10.def.3.1]
Therefore the first apotome  has been found.
