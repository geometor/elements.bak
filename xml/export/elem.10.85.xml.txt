> To find the first apotome.

Proof:
Let a rational straight line > A be set out, and let > BG be commensurable in length with > A; therefore > BG is also rational.
Let two square numbers > DE, > EF be set out, and let their difference > FD not be square; therefore neither has > ED to > DF the ratio which a square number has to a square number.
Let it be contrived that, as > ED is to > DF, so is the square on > BG to the square on > GC; [elem.10.6.p.1] therefore the square on > BG is commensurable with the square on > GC. [elem.10.6]
But the square on > BG is rational; therefore the square on > GC is also rational; therefore > GC is also rational.
And, since > ED has not to > DF the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore neither has the square on > BG to the square on > GC the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore > BG is incommensurable in length with > GC. [elem.10.9]
And both are rational; therefore > BG, > GC are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore > BC is an apotome. [elem.10.73]
I say next that it is also a first apotome.
For let the square on > H be that by which the square on > BG is greater than the square on > GC.
Now since. as > ED is to > FD, so is the square on > BG to the square on > GC, therefore also, , [elem.5.19.p.1] as > DE is to > EF, so is the square on > GB to the square on > H.
But > DE has to > EF the ratio which a square number has to a square number, for each is square; therefore the square on > GB also has to the square on > H the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore > BG is commensurable in length with > H. [elem.10.9]
And the square on > BG is greater than the square on > GC by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with > BG.
And the whole > BG is commensurable in length with the rational straight line > A set out.
Therefore > BC is a first apotome. [elem.10.def.3.1]
Therefore the first apotome > BC has been found. > (Being) that which it was required to find.
