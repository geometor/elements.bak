Proof:
Let  be major, and let  be commensurable with ; I say that  is major.
Let  be divided at ; therefore ,  are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them rational, but the rectangle contained by them medial. [elem.10.39]
Let the same construction be made as before.
Then since, as  is to , so is  to , and  to , therefore also, as  is to , so is  to . [elem.5.11]
But  is commensurable with ; therefore ,  are also commensurable with ,  respectively. [elem.10.11]
And since, as  is to , so is  to , alternately also, as  is to , so is  to ; [elem.5.16] therefore also, , as  is to , so is  to ; [elem.5.18] therefore also, as the square on  is to the square on , so is the square on  to the square on . [elem.6.20]
Similarly we can prove that, as the square on  is to the square on , so also is the square on  to the square on .
Therefore also, as the square on  is to the squares on , , so is the square on  to the squares on , ; therefore also, alternately, as the square on  is to the square on , so are the squares on ,  to the squares on , . [elem.5.16]
But the square on  is commensurable with the square on ; therefore the squares on ,  are also commensurable with the squares on , .
And the squares on ,  together are rational; therefore the squares on ,  together are rational.
Similarly also twice the rectangle ,  is commensurable with twice the rectangle , .
And twice the rectangle ,  is medial; therefore twice the rectangle ,  is also medial. [elem.10.23.p.1]
Therefore ,  are straight lines incommensurable in square which make, at the same time, the sum of the squares on them rational, but the rectangle contained by them medial; therefore the whole  is the irrational straight line called major. [elem.10.39]
Therefore a straight line commensurable with the major straight line is major. Q. E. D.
