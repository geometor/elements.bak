> A straight line commensurable with a major straight line is itself also major.

Proof:
Let > AB be major, and let > CD be commensurable with > AB; I say that > CD is major.
Let > AB be divided at > E; therefore > AE, > EB are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them rational, but the rectangle contained by them medial. [elem.10.39]
Let the same construction be made as before.
Then since, as > AB is to > CD, so is > AE to > CF, and > EB to > FD, therefore also, as > AE is to > CF, so is > EB to > FD. [elem.5.11]
But > AB is commensurable with > CD; therefore > AE, > EB are also commensurable with > CF, > FD respectively. [elem.10.11]
And since, as > AE is to > CF, so is > EB to > FD, alternately also, as > AE is to > EB, so is > CF to > FD; [elem.5.16] therefore also, , as > AB is to > BE, so is > CD to > DF; [elem.5.18] therefore also, as the square on > AB is to the square on > BE, so is the square on > CD to the square on > DF. [elem.6.20]
Similarly we can prove that, as the square on > AB is to the square on > AE, so also is the square on > CD to the square on > CF.
Therefore also, as the square on > AB is to the squares on > AE, > EB, so is the square on > CD to the squares on > CF, > FD; therefore also, alternately, as the square on > AB is to the square on > CD, so are the squares on > AE, > EB to the squares on > CF, > FD. [elem.5.16]
But the square on > AB is commensurable with the square on > CD; therefore the squares on > AE, > EB are also commensurable with the squares on > CF, > FD.
And the squares on > AE, > EB together are rational; therefore the squares on > CF, > FD together are rational.
Similarly also twice the rectangle > AE, > EB is commensurable with twice the rectangle > CF, > FD.
And twice the rectangle > AE, > EB is medial; therefore twice the rectangle > CF, > FD is also medial. [elem.10.23.p.1]
Therefore > CF, > FD are straight lines incommensurable in square which make, at the same time, the sum of the squares on them rational, but the rectangle contained by them medial; therefore the whole > CD is the irrational straight line called major. [elem.10.39]
Therefore a straight line commensurable with the major straight line is major. Q. E. D.
