Enunciation:
> If four magnitudes be proportional, and the first be commensurable with the second, the third will also be commensurable with the fourth; and, if the first be incommensurable with the second, the third will also be incommensurable with the fourth.

Proof:
Let > A, > B, > C, > D be four magnitudes in proportion, so that, as > A is to > B, so is > C to > D, and let > A be commensurable with > B;  I say that > C will also be commensurable with > D.
For, since > A is commensurable with > B, therefore > A has to > B the ratio which a number has to a number. [elem.10.5]
And, as > A is to > B, so is > C to > D; therefore > C also has to > D the ratio which a number has to a number; therefore > C is commensurable with > D. [elem.10.6]
Next, let > A be incommensurable with > B; I say that > C will also be incommensurable with > D.
For, since > A is incommensurable with > B, therefore > A has not to > B the ratio which a number has to a number. [elem.10.7]
And, as > A is to > B, so is > C to > D; therefore neither has > C to > D the ratio which a number has to a number; therefore > C is incommensurable with > D. [elem.10.8]
Therefore etc.
