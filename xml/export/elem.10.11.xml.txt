Let , , ,  be four magnitudes in proportion, so that, as  is to , so is  to , and let  be commensurable with ;  will also be commensurable with .

And, as  is to , so is  to ; therefore  also has to  the ratio which a number has to a number; therefore  is commensurable with . [elem.10.6]
Next, let  be incommensurable with ; I say that  will also be incommensurable with .
For, since  is incommensurable with , therefore  has not to  the ratio which a number has to a number. [elem.10.7]
And, as  is to , so is  to ; therefore neither has  to  the ratio which a number has to a number; therefore  is incommensurable with . [elem.10.8]
Therefore etc.
