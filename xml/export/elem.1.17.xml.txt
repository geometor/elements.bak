Enunciation:
In any triangle two angles taken together in any manner are less than two right angles.

Proof:
Let `ABC` be a triangle; I say that two angles of the triangle `ABC` taken together in any manner are less than two right angles.
For let `BC` be produced to `D`. [elem.1.post.2]
Then, since the angle `ACD` is an exterior angle of the triangle `ABC`,
it is greater than the interior and opposite angle `ABC`. [elem.1.16]  therefore the angles `ACD`, `ACB` are greater than the angles `ABC`, `BCA`. `ACD`, `ACB` are equal to two right angles. [elem.1.13]
Therefore the angles `ABC`, `BCA` are less than two right angles.
Similarly we can prove that the angles `BAC`, `ACB` are also less than two right angles, and so are the angles `CAB`, `ABC` as well.
Therefore etc.
