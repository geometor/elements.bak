Enunciation:


Proof:
Let  be a number; I say that  either is prime or is measured by some prime number.
If now  is prime, that which was enjoined will have been done.
But if it is composite, some prime number will measure it. [elem.7.31]
Therefore any number either is prime or is measured by some prime number. Q. E. D.
