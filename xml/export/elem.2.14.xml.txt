Enunciation:
`To construct a square equal to a given rectilineal figure`.

Proof:
Let `A` be the given rectilineal figure; thus it is required to construct a square equal to the rectilineal figure `A`.
For let there be constructed the rectangular parallelogram `BD` equal to the rectilineal figure `A`. [elem.1.45]
Then, if `BE` is equal to `ED`, that which was enjoined will have been done; for a square `BD` has been constructed equal to the rectilineal figure `A`.
But, if not, one of the straight lines `BE`, `ED` is greater.
Let `BE` be greater, and let it be produced to `F`; let `EF` be made equal to `ED`, and let `BF` be bisected at `G`.
With centre `G` and distance one of the straight lines `GB`, `GF` let the semicircle `BHF` be described; let `DE` be produced `H`, and let `GH` be joined.
Then, since the straight line `BF` has been cut into equal segments at `G`, and into unequal segments at `E`,
But `GF` is equal to `GH`; therefore the rectangle `BE`, `EF` together with the square on `GE` is equal to the square on `GH`.
But the squares on `HE`, `EG` are equal to the square on `GH`; [elem.1.47] `BE`, `EF` together with the square on `GE` is equal to the squares on `HE`, `EG`.
Let the square on `GE` be subtracted from each;
But the rectangle `BE`, `EF` is `BD`, for `EF` is equal to `ED`;
And `BD` is equal to the rectilineal figure `A`.
Therefore the rectilineal figure `A` is also equal to the square `EH`.
Therefore a square, namely that which can be described on `EH`, has been constructed equal to the given rectilineal figure `A`. Q. E. F.
