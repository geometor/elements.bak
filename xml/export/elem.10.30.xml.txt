Proof:
Let there be set out a rational straight line , and two square numbers ,  such that their sum  is not square; [elem.10.28.l.2]  the semicircle , let it be contrived that, as  is to , so is the square on  to the square on , [elem.10.6.p.1] and let  be joined.
Then, in a similar manner to the preceding, we can prove that ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only.
And since, as  is to , so is the square on  to the square on , therefore, , as  is to , so is the square on  to the square on . [elem.5.19.p.1, elem.3.31, elem.1.47]
But  has not to  the ratio which a square number has to a square number;  to the square on  the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore  is incommensurable in length with . [elem.10.9]
And the square on  is greater than the square on  by the square on  incommensurable with .
Therefore ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, and the square on  is greater than the square on  by the square on  incommensurable in length with . Q. E. D.
