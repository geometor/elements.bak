Enunciation:
`Of straight lines in a circle the diameter is greatest`, `and of the rest the nearer to the centre is always greater than the more remote`.

Proof:
Let `ABCD` be a circle, let `AD` be its diameter and `E` the centre; and let `BC` be nearer to the diameter `AD`, and `FG` more remote; I say that `AD` is greatest and `BC` greater than `FG`.
For from the centre `E` let `EH`, `EK`
        be drawn perpendicular to `BC`, `FG`.
Then, since `BC` is nearer to the centre and `FG` more remote, `EK` is greater than `EH`. [elem.3.def.5]
Let `EL` be made equal to `EH`, through `L` let `LM` be drawn at right angles to `EK` and carried through to `N`, and let `ME`, `EN`, `FE`, `EG` be joined.
Then, since `EH` is equal to `EL`, > `BC` is also equal to `MN`. [elem.3.14]
Again, since `AE` is equal to `EM`, and `ED` to `EN`, > `AD` is equal to `ME`, `EN`.
But `ME`, `EN` are greater than `MN`, [elem.1.20] and `MN` is equal to `BC`; > therefore `AD` is greater than `BC`.
And, since the two sides `ME`, `EN` are equal to the two sides `FE`, `EG`, and the angle `MEN` greater than the angle `FEG`, therefore the base `MN` is greater than the base `FG`. [elem.1.24]
But `MN` was proved equal to `BC`.
Therefore the diameter `AD` is greatest and `BC` greater than `FG`.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
