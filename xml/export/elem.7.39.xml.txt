Enunciation:
> To find the number which is the least that will have given parts.

Proof:
Let > A, > B, > C be the given parts; thus it is required to find the number which is the least that will have the parts > A, > B, > C.
Let > D, > E, > F be numbers called by the same name as the parts > A, > B, > C, and let > G, the least number measured by > D, > E, > F, be taken. [elem.7.36]
Therefore > G has parts called by the same name as > D, > E, > F. [elem.7.37]
But > A, > B, > C are parts called by the same name as > D, > E, > F; therefore > G has the parts > A, > B, > C.
I say next that it is also the least number that has.
For, if not, there will be some number less than > G which will have the parts > A, > B, > C.
Let it be > H.
Since > H has the parts > A, > B, > C, therefore > H will be measured by numbers called by the same name as the parts > A, > B, > C. [elem.7.38]
But > D, > E, > F are numbers called by the same name as the parts > A, > B, > C; therefore > H is measured by > D, > E, > F.
And it is less than > G : which is impossible.
Therefore there will be no number less than > G that will have the parts > A, > B, > C. Q. E. D.
