To draw a straight line at right angles to a given straight line from a given point on it.

Proof:
Let `AB` be the given straight line, and `C` the given point on it.
Thus it is required to draw from the point `C` a straight line at right angles to the straight line `AB`.
Let a point `D` be taken at random on `AC`; let `CE` be made equal to `CD`; [elem.1.3] on `DE` let the equilateral triangle `FDE` be constructed, [elem.1.1] and let `FC` be joined;
I say that the straight line `FC` has been drawn at right angles to the given straight line `AB` from `C` the given point on it.
For, since `DC` is equal to `CE`, and `CF` is common, > the two sides `DC`, `CF` are equal to the two sides `EC`, `CF` respectively; and the base `DF` is equal to the base `FE`; > therefore the angle `DCF` is equal to the angle `ECF`; [elem.1.8] and they are adjacent angles.
But, when a straight line set up on a straight line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right; [elem.1.def.10] > therefore each of the angles `DCF`, `FCE` is right.
Therefore the straight line `CF` has been drawn at right angles to the given straight line `AB` from the given point `C` on it.
