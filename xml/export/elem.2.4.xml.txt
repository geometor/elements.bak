`If a straight line be cut at random`, `the square on the whole is equal to the squares on the segments and twice the rectangle contained by the segments`.

Proof:
For let the straight line `AB` be cut at random at `C`; I say that the square on `AB` is equal to the squares on `AC`, `CB` and twice the rectangle contained by `AC`, `CB`.
For let the square `ADEB` be described on `AB`, [elem.1.46] let `BD` be joined; through `C` let `CF` be drawn parallel to either `AD` or `EB`, and through `G` let `HK` be drawn parallel to either `AB` or `DE`. [elem.1.31]
Then, since `CF` is parallel to `AD`, and `BD` has fallen on them, the exterior angle `CGB` is equal to the interior and opposite angle `ADB`. [elem.1.29]
But the angle `ADB` is equal to the angle `ABD`, > since the side `BA` is also equal to `AD`; [elem.1.5] therefore the angle `CGB` is also equal to the angle `GBC`, so that the side `BC` is also equal to the side `CG`. [elem.1.6]
But `CB` is equal to `GK`, and `CG` to `KB`; [elem.1.34] > therefore `GK` is also equal to `KB`; therefore `CGKB` is equilateral.
I say next that it is also right-angled.
For, since `CG` is parallel to `BK`, > the angles `KBC`, `GCB` are equal to two right angles. [elem.1.29]
But the angle `KBC` is right; > therefore the angle `BCG` is also right, so that the opposite angles `CGK`, `GKB` are also right. [elem.1.34]
Therefore `CGKB` is right-angled; and it was also proved equilateral; > therefore it is a square;  and it is described on `CB`.
For the same reason > `HF` is also a square; and it is described on `HG`, that is `AC`. [elem.1.34]
Therefore the squares `HF`, `KC` are the squares on `AC`, `CB`.
Now, since `AG` is equal to `GE`, and `AG` is the rectangle `AC`, `CB`, for `GC` is equal to `CB`, > therefore `GE` is also equal to the rectangle `AC`, `CB`.
Therefore `AG`, `GE` are equal to twice the rectangle `AC`, `CB`.
But the squares `HF`, `CK` are also the squares on `AC`, `CB`; therefore the four areas `HF`, `CK`, `AG`, `GE` are equal to the squares on `AC`, `CB` and twice the rectangle contained by `AC`, `CB`.
But `HF`, `CK`, `AG`, `GE` are the whole `ADEB`, which is the square on `AB`.
Therefore the square on `AB` is equal to the squares on `AC`, `CB` and twice the rectangle contained by `AC`, `CB`.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
