Enunciation:
To bisect a given rectilineal angle.

Proof:
Let the angle `BAC` be the given rectilineal angle.
Thus it is required to bisect it.
Let a point `D` be taken at random on `AB`; let `AE` be cut off from `AC` equal to `AD`; [elem.1.3] let `DE` be joined, and on `DE` let the equilateral triangle `DEF` be constructed; let `AF` be joined.
I say that the angle `BAC` has been bisected by the straight line `AF`.
For, since `AD` is equal to `AE`, and `AF` is common,
And the base `DF` is equal to the base `EF`;
Therefore the given rectilineal angle `BAC` has been bisected by the straight line `AF`.
