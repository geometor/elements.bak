`To construct one and the same figure similar to a given rectilineal figure and equal to another given rectilineal figure`.

Proof:
Let `ABC` be the given rectilineal figure to which the figure to be constructed must be similar, and `D` that to which it must be equal; thus it is required to construct one and the same figure similar to `ABC` and equal to `D`.
Let there be applied to `BC` the parallelogram `BE` equal to the triangle `ABC` [elem.1.44], and to `CE` the parallelogram `CM` equal to `D` in the angle `FCE` which is equal to the angle `CBL`. [elem.1.45]
Therefore `BC` is in a straight line with `CF`, and `LE` with `EM`.
Now let `GH` be taken a mean proportional to `BC`, `CF` [elem.6.13], and on `GH` let `KGH` be described similar and similarly situated to `ABC`. [elem.6.18]
Then, since, as `BC` is to `GH`, so is `GH` to `CF`, and, if three straight lines be proportional, as the first is to the third, so is the figure on the first to the similar and similarly situated figure described on the second, [elem.6.19.p.1] therefore, as `BC` is to `CF`, so is the triangle `ABC` to the triangle `KGH`.
But, as `BC` is to `CF`, so also is the parallelogram `BE` to the parallelogram `EF`. [elem.6.1]
Therefore also, as the triangle `ABC` is to the triangle `KGH`, so is the parallelogram `BE` to the parallelogram `EF`; therefore, alternately, as the triangle `ABC` is to the parallelogram `BE`, so is the triangle `KGH` to the parallelogram `EF`. [elem.5.16]
But the triangle `ABC` is equal to the parallelogram `BE`; therefore the triangle `KGH` is also equal to the parallelogram `EF`.
But the parallelogram `EF` is equal to `D`; therefore `KGH` is also equal to `D`.
And `KGH` is also similar to `ABC`.
Therefore one and the same figure `KGH` has been constructed similar to the given rectilineal figure `ABC` and equal to the other given figure `D`. Q. E. D.
