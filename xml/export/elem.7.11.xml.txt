> If, as whole is to whole, so is a number subtracted to a number subtracted, the remainder will also be to the remainder as whole to whole.

Proof:
As the whole > AB is to the whole > CD, so let > AE subtracted be to > CF subtracted; I say that the remainder > EB is also to the remainder > FD as the whole > AB to the whole > CD.
Since, as > AB is to > CD, so is > AE to > CF, whatever part or parts > AB is of > CD, the same part or the same parts is > AE of > CF also; [elem.7.def.20]
Therefore also the remainder > EB is the same part or parts of > FD that > AB is of > CD. [elem.7.7 elem.7.8]
Therefore, as > EB is to > FD, so is > AB to > CD. [elem.7.def.20] Q. E. D.
