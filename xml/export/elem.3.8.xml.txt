Enunciation:
`If a point be taken outside a circle and from the point straight lines be drawn through to the circle`, `one of which is through the centre and the others are drawn at random`, `then`, `of the straight lines which fall on the concave circumference`, `that through the centre is greatest`, `while of the rest`
       `the nearer to that through the centre is always greater than the more remote`, `but`, `of the straight lines falling on the convex circumference`, `that between the point and the diameter is least`, `while of the rest the nearer to the least is always less than the more remote`, `and only two equal straight lines will fall on the circle from the point`, `one on each side of the least`.

Proof:
Let `ABC` be a circle, and let a point `D` be taken outside `ABC`; let there be drawn through from it straight lines `DA`, `DE`, `DF`, `DC`, and let `DA` be through the centre; I say that, of the straight lines falling on the concave circumference `AEFC`, the straight line `DA` through the centre is greatest,  while `DE` is greater than `DF` and `DF` than `DC`.; but, of the straight lines falling on the convex circumference `HLKG`, the straight line `DG` between the point and the diameter `AG` is least; and the nearer to the least `DG` is always less than the more remote, namely `DK` than `DL`, and `DL` than `DH`.
For let the centre of the circle `ABC` be taken [elem.3.1], and let it be `M`; let `ME`, `MF`, `MC`, `MK`, `ML`, `MH` be joined.
Then, since `AM` is equal to `EM`, let `MD` be added to each; > therefore `AD` is equal to `EM`, `MD`.
But `EM`, `MD` are greater than `ED`; [elem.1.20] > therefore `AD` is also greater than `ED`.
Again, since `ME` is equal to `MF`, > and `MD` is common, therefore `EM`, `MD` are equal to `FM`, `MD`; > and the angle `EMD` is greater than the angle `FMD`;
       > therefore the base `ED` is greater than the base `FD`. [elem.1.24]
Similarly we can prove that `FD` is greater than `CD`; therefore `DA` is greatest, while `DE` is greater than `DF`, and `DF` than `DC`.
Next, since `MK`, `KD` are greater than `MD`, [elem.1.20] and `MG` is equal to `MK`, therefore the remainder `KD` is greater than the remainder `GD`, > so that `GD` is less than `KD`.
And, since on `MD`, one of the sides of the triangle `MLD`, two straight lines `MK`, `KD` were constructed meeting within the triangle, therefore `MK`, `KD` are less than `ML`, `LD`; [elem.1.21] and `MK` is equal to `ML`; > therefore the remainder `DK` is less than the remainder `DL`.
Similarly we can prove that `DL` is also less than `DH`; > therefore `DG` is least, while `DK` is less than `DL`, and `DL` than `DH`.
I say also that only two equal straight lines will fall from the point `D` on the circle, one on each side of the least `DG`.
On the straight line `MD`, and at the point `M` on it, let the angle `DMB` be constructed equal to the angle `KMD`, and let `DB` be joined.
Then, since `MK` is equal to `MB`, and `MD` is common, > the two sides `KM`, `MD` are equal to the two sides `BM`, `MD` respectively; and the angle `KMD` is equal to the angle `BMD`; > therefore the base `DK` is equal to the base `DB`. [elem.1.4]
I say that no other straight line equal to the straight line `DK` will fall on the circle from the point `D`.
For, if possible, let a straight line so fall, and let it be `DN`. > Then, since `DK` is equal to `DN`,
while `DK` is equal to `DB`, > `DB` is also equal to `DN`, that is, the nearer to the least `DG` equal to the more remote: which was proved impossible.
Therefore no more than two equal straight lines will fall on the circle `ABC` from the point `D`, one on each side of `DG` the least.
Therefore etc.
