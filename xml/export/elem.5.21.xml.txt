Enunciation:
`If there be three magnitudes`, `and others equal to them in multitude`, `which taken two and two together are in the same ratio`, `and the proportion of them be perturbed`, `then`, `if`
       `the first magnitude is greater than the third`, `the fourth will also be greater than the sixth; if equal`, `equal; and if less`, `less`.

Proof:
Let there be three magnitudes `A`, `B`, `C`, and others `D`, `E`, `F` equal to them in multitude, which taken two and two are in the same ratio, and let the proportion of them be perturbed, so that, > as `A` is to `B`, so is `E` to `F`, and, as `B` is to `C`, so is `D` to `E`, and let `A` be greater than `C`
       ; I say that `D` will also be greater than `F`; if `A` is equal to `C`, equal; and if less, less.
For, since `A` is greater than `C`, and `B` is some other magnitude, therefore `A` has to `B` a greater ratio than `C` has to `B`. [elem.5.8]
But, as `A` is to `B`, so is `E` to `F`, and, as `C` is to `B`, inversely, so is `E` to `D`. Therefore also `E` has to `F` a greater ratio than `E` has to `D`. [elem.5.13]
But that to which the same has a greater ratio is less; [elem.5.10] > therefore `F` is less than `D`; therefore `D` is greater than `F`.
Similarly we can prove that, > if `A` be equal to `C`, `D` will also be equal to `F`; and if less, less.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
