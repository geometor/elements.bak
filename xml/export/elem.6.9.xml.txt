Enunciation:
`From a given straight line to cut off a prescribed part`.

Proof:
Let `AB` be the given straight line; thus it is required to cut off from `AB` a prescribed part.
Let the third part be that prescribed.
Let a straight line `AC` be drawn through from `A` containing with `AB` any angle; let a point `D` be taken at random on `AC`, and let `DE`, `EC` be made equal to `AD`. [elem.1.3]
Let `BC` be joined, and through `D` let `DF` be drawn parallel to it. [elem.1.31]
Then, since `FD` has been drawn parallel to `BC`, one of the sides of the triangle `ABC`, therefore, proportionally, as `CD` is to `DA`, so is `BF` to `FA`. [elem.6.2]
But `CD` is double of `DA`; > therefore `BF` is also double of `FA`; therefore `BA` is triple of `AF`.
Therefore from the given straight line `AB` the prescribed third part `AF` has been cut off. Q. E. F.
