> A second bimedial straight line is divided at one point only.

Proof:
Let > AB be a second bimedial straight line divided at > C, so that > AC, > CB are medial straight lines commensurable in square only and containing a medial rectangle; [elem.10.38
] it is then manifest that > C is not at the point of bisection, because the segments are not commensurable in length.
I say that > AB is not so divided at another point.
For, if possible, let it be divided at > D also, so that > AC is not the same with > DB, but > AC is supposed greater; it is then clear that the squares on > AD, > DB are also, as we proved above [Lemma], less than the squares on > AC, > CB; and suppose that > AD, > DB are medial straight lines commensurable in square only and containing a medial rectangle.
Now let a rational straight line > EF be set out, let there be applied to > EF the rectangular parallelogram > EK equal to the square on > AB, and let > EG equal to the squares on > AC, > CB be subtracted; therefore the remainder > HK is equal to twice the rectangle > AC, > CB. [elem.2.4
]
Again, let there be subtracted > EL, equal to the squares on > AD, > DB, which were proved less than the squares on > AC, > CB [elem.10.41.l.1
]; therefore the remainder > MK is also equal to twice the rectangle > AD, > DB.
Now, since the squares on > AC, > CB are medial, therefore > EG is medial.
And it is applied to the rational straight line > EF; therefore > EH is rational and incommensurable in length with > EF. [elem.10.22
]
For the same reason > HN is also rational and incommensurable in length with > EF.
And, since > AC, > CB are medial straight lines commensurable in square only, therefore > AC is incommensurable in length with > CB.
But, as > AC is to > CB, so is the square on > AC to the rectangle > AC, > CB; therefore the square on > AC is incommensurable with the rectangle > AC, > CB. [elem.10.11
]
But the squares on > AC, > CB are commensurable with the square on > AC; for > AC, > CB are commensurable in square. [elem.10.15
]
And twice the rectangle > AC, > CB is commensurable with the rectangle > AC, > CB. [elem.10.6
]
Therefore the squares on > AC, > CB are also incommensurable with twice the rectangle > AC, > CB. [elem.10.13
]
But > EG is equal to the squares on > AC, > CB, and > HK is equal to twice the rectangle > AC, > CB; therefore > EG is incommensurable with > HK, so that > EH is also incommensurable in length with > HN. [elem.6.1
, elem.10.11
]
And they are rational; therefore > EH, > HN are rational straight lines commensurable in square only.
But, if two rational straight lines commensurable in square only be added together, the whole is the irrational which is called binomial. [elem.10.36
]
Therefore > EN is a binomial straight line divided at > H.
In the same way > EM, > MN will also be proved to be rational straight lines commensurable in square only; and > EN will be a binomial straight line divided at different points, > H and > M.
And > EH is not the same with > MN.
For the squares on > AC, > CB are greater than the squares on > AD, > DB.
But the squares on > AD, > DB are greater than twice the rectangle > AD, > DB; therefore also the squares on > AC, > CB, that is, > EG, are much greater than twice the rectangle > AD, > DB, that is, > MK, so that > EH is also greater than > MN.
Therefore > EH is not the same with > MN. Q. E. D.
