Enunciation:
When, one side of those about the right angle in a right-angled triangle remaining fixed, the triangle is carried round and restored again to the same position from which it began to be moved, the figure so comprehended is a > cone.

Proof:
And, if the straight line which remains fixed be equal to the remaining side about the right angle which is carried round, the cone will be > right-angled; if less, > obtuse-angled; and if greater, > acute-angled.
