Enunciation:
> Parallelepipedal solids which are of the same height are to one another as their bases.

Proof:
Let > AB, > CD be parallelepipedal solids of the same height; I say that the parallelepipedal solids > AB, > CD are to one another as their bases, that is, that, as the base > AE is to the base > CF, so is the solid > AB to the solid > CD.
For let > FH equal to > AE be applied to > FG, [elem.1.45] and on > FH as base, and with the same height as that of > CD, let the parallelepipedal solid > GK be completed.
Then the solid > AB is equal to the solid > GK; for they are on equal bases > AE, > FH and of the same height. [elem.11.31]
And, since the parallelepipedal solid > CK is cut by the plane > DG which is parallel to opposite planes, therefore, as the base > CF is to the base > FH, so is the solid > CD to the solid > DH. [elem.11.25]
But the base > FH is equal to the base > AE, and the solid > GK to the solid > AB; therefore also, as the base > AE is to the base > CF, so is the solid > AB to the solid > CD.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
