Enunciation:
`In a given circle to inscribe a square`.

Proof:
Let `ABCD` be the given circle; thus it is required to inscribe a square in the circle `ABCD`.
Let two diameters `AC`, `BD` of the circle `ABCD` be drawn at right angles to one another, and let `AB`, `BC`, `CD`, `DA` be joined.
Then, since `BE` is equal to `ED`, for `E` is the centre, and `EA` is common and at right angles, therefore the base `AB` is equal to the base `AD`. [elem.1.4]
For the same reason each of the straight lines `BC`, `CD` is also equal to each of the straight lines `AB`, `AD`; > therefore the quadrilateral `ABCD` is equilateral.
I say next that it is also right-angled.
For, since the straight line `BD` is a diameter of the circle `ABCD`, therefore `BAD` is a semicircle; > therefore the angle `BAD` is right. [elem.3.31]
For the same reason each of the angles `ABC`, `BCD`, `CDA` is also right; > therefore the quadrilateral `ABCD` is right-angled.
But it was also proved equilateral; therefore it is a square; [elem.1.def.22] and it has been inscribed in the circle `ABCD`.
Therefore in the given circle the square `ABCD` has been inscribed. Q. E. F.
