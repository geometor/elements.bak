`In a given square to inscribe a circle`.

Proof:
Let `ABCD` be the given square; thus it is required to inscribe a circle in the given square `ABCD`.
Let the straight lines `AD`, `AB` be bisected at the points `E`, `F` respectively [elem.1.10], through `E` let `EH` be drawn parallel to either `AB` or `CD`, and through `F` let `FK` be drawn parallel to either `AD` or `BC`; [elem.1.31] therefore each of the figures `AK`, `KB`, `AH`, `HD`, `AG`, `GC`, `BG`, `GD` is a parallelogram, and their opposite sides are evidently equal. [elem.1.34]
Now, since `AD` is equal to `AB`, and `AE` is half of `AD`, and `AF` half of `AB`, > therefore `AE` is equal to `AF`, so that the opposite sides are also equal;
       > therefore `FG` is equal to `GE`.
Similarly we can prove that each of the straight lines `GH`, `GK` is equal to each of the straight lines `FG`, `GE`; > therefore the four straight lines `GE`, `GF`, `GH`, `GK` are equal to one another.
Therefore the circle described with centre `G` and distance one of the straight lines `GE`, `GF`, `GH`, `GK` will pass also through the remaining points.
And it will touch the straight lines `AB`, `BC`, `CD`, `DA`, because the angles at `E`, `F`, `H`, `K` are right.
For, if the circle cuts `AB`, `BC`, `CD`, `DA`, the straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter of the circle from its extremity will fall within the circle : which was proved absurd; [elem.3.16] therefore the circle described with centre `G` and distance one of the straight lines `GE`, `GF`, `GH`, `GK` will not cut the straight lines `AB`, `BC`, `CD`, `DA`.
Therefore it will touch them, and will have been inscribed in the square `ABCD`.
Therefore in the given square a circle has been inscribed. Q. E. F.
