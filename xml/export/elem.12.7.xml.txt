> Any prism which has a triangular base is divided into three pyramids equal to one another which have triangular bases.

Proof:
Let there be a prism in which the triangle > ABC is the base and > DEF its opposite; I say that the prism > ABCDEF is divided into three pyramids equal to one another, which have triangular bases.
For let > BD, > EC, > CD be joined.
Since > ABED is a parallelogram, and > BD is its diameter, therefore the triangle > ABD is equal to the triangle > EBD; [elem.1.34] therefore also the pyramid of which the triangle > ABD is the base and the point > C the vertex is equal to the pyramid of which the triangle > DEB is the base and the point > C the vertex. [elem.12.5]
But the pyramid of which the triangle > DEB is the base and the point > C the vertex is the same with the pyramid of which the triangle > EBC is the base and the point > D the vertex; for they are contained by the same planes.
Therefore the pyramid of which the triangle > ABD is the base and the point > C the vertex is also equal to the pyramid of which the triangle > EBC is the base and the point > D the vertex.
Again, since > FCBE is a parallelogram, and > CE is its diameter, the triangle > CEF is equal to the triangle > CBE. [elem.1.34]
Therefore also the pyramid of which the triangle > BCE is the base and the point > D the vertex is equal to the pyramid of which the triangle > ECF is the base and the point > D the vertex. [elem.12.5]
But the pyramid of which the triangle > BCE is the base and the point > D the vertex was proved equal to the pyramid of which the triangle > ABD is the base and the point > C the vertex; therefore also the pyramid of which the triangle > CEF is the base and the point > D the vertex is equal to the pyramid of which the triangle > ABD is the base and the point > C the vertex; therefore the prism > ABCDEF has been divided into three pyramids equal to one another which have triangular bases.
And, since the pyramid of which the triangle > ABD is the base and the point > C the vertex is the same with the pyramid of which the triangle > CAB is the base and the point > D the vertex, for they are contained by the same planes, while the pyramid of which the triangle > ABD is the base and the point > C the vertex was proved to be a third of the prism in which the triangle > ABC is the base and > DEF its opposite, therefore also the pyramid of which the triangle > ABC is the base and the point > D the vertex is a third of the prism which has the same base, the triangle > ABC, and > DEF as its opposite.
