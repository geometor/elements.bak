Proof:
For let any straight line  be cut in extreme and mean ratio at the point , let  be the greater segment, and let  be bisected at ; I say that the square on  is five times the square on .
For let the square  be described on , and let the figure be drawn double.
Since  is double of , therefore the square on  is quadruple of the square on , that is,  is quadruple of .
And, since the rectangle ,  is equal to the square on , and  is the rectangle , , therefore  is equal to .
But  is quadruple of ; therefore  is also quadruple of .
Again, since  is equal to ,  is also equal to .
Hence the square  is also equal to the square .
Therefore  is equal to , that is,  to ; hence  is also equal to .
But  is equal to ; therefore  is also equal to .
Let  be added to each; therefore the gnomon  is equal to .
But  was proved quadruple of ; therefore the gnomon  is also quadruple of the square .
Therefore the gnomon  and the square  are five times .
But the gnomon  and the square  are the square .
And  is the square on , and  the square on .
Therefore the square on  is five times the square on . Q. E. D.
