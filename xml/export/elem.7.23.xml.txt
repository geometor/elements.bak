Enunciation:
> If two number be prime to one another, the number which measures the one of them will be prime to the remaining number.

Proof:
Let > A, > B be two numbers prime to one another, and let any number > C measure > A; I say that > C, > B are also prime to one another.
For, if > C, > B are not prime to one another, some number will measure > C, > B.
Let a number measure them, and let it be > D.
Since > D measures > C, and > C measures > A, therefore > D also measures > A.
But it also measures > B; therefore > D measures > A, > B which are prime to one another: which is impossible. [elem.7.def.12]
Therefore no number will measure the numbers > C, > B.
Therefore > C, > B are prime to one another. Q. E. D.
