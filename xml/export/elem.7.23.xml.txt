Proof:
Let ,  be two numbers prime to one another, and let any number  measure ; I say that ,  are also prime to one another.
For, if ,  are not prime to one another, some number will measure , .
Let a number measure them, and let it be .
Since  measures , and  measures , therefore  also measures .
But it also measures ;  measures ,  which are prime to one another: which is impossible. [elem.7.def.12]
Therefore no number will measure the numbers , .
Therefore ,  are prime to one another. Q. E. D.
