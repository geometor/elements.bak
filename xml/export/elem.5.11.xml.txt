Enunciation:
`Ratios which are the same with the same ratio are also the same with one another`.

Proof:
For, as `A` is to `B`, so let `C` be to `D`, and, as `C` is to `D`, so let `E` be to `F`; I say that, as `A` is to `B`, so is `E` to `F`.
For of `A`, `C`, `E` let equimultiples `G`, `H`, `K` be taken, and of `B`, `D`, `F` other, chance, equimultiples `L`, `M`, `N`.
Then since, as `A` is to `B`, so is `C` to `D`, and of `A`, `C` equimultiples `G`, `H` have been taken, and of `B`, `D` other, chance, equimultiples `L`, `M`, therefore, if `G` is in excess of `L`, `H` is also in excess of `M`, if equal, equal, and if less, less.
Again, since, as `C` is to `D`, so is `E` to `F`, and of `C`, `E` equimultiples `H`, `K` have been taken, and of `D`, `F` other, chance, equimultiples `M`, `N`, therefore, if `H` is in excess of `M`, `K` is also in excess of `N`, if equal, equal, and if less, less.
But we saw that, if `H` was in excess of `M`, `G` was also in excess of `L`; if equal, equal; and if less, less; so that, in addition, if `G` is in excess of `L`, `K` is also in excess of `N`, if equal, equal, and if less, less.
And `G`, `K` are equimultiples of `A`, `E`, while `L`, `N` are other, chance, equimultiples of `B`, `F`;
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
