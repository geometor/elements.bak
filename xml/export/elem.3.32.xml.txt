Enunciation:
`If a straight line touch a circle`, `and from the point of contact there be drawn across`, `in the circle`, `a straight line cutting the circle`, `the angles which it makes with the tangent will be equal to the angles in the alternate segments of the circle`.

Proof:
For let a straight line `EF` touch the circle `ABCD` at the point `B`, and from the point `B` let there be drawn across, in the circle `ABCD`, a straight line `BD` cutting it; I say that the angles which `BD` makes with the tangent `EF` will be equal to the angles in the alternate segments of the circle, that is, that the angle `FBD` is equal to the angle constructed in the segment `BAD`, and the angle `EBD` is equal to the angle constructed in the segment `DCB`.
For let `BA` be drawn from `B` at right angles to `EF`, let a point `C` be taken at random on the circumference `BD`,  and let `AD`, `DC`, `CB` be joined.
Then, since a straight line `EF` touches the circle `ABCD` at `B`, and `BA` has been drawn from the point of contact at right angles to the tangent, the centre of the circle `ABCD` is on `BA`. [elem.3.19]
Therefore `BA` is a diameter of the circle `ABCD`;
Therefore the remaining angles `BAD`, `ABD` are equal to one right angle. [elem.1.32]
But the angle `ABF` is also right; therefore the angle `ABF` is equal to the angles `BAD`, `ABD`.
Let the angle `ABD` be subtracted from each; therefore the angle `DBF` which remains is equal to the angle `BAD` in the alternate segment of the circle.
Next, since `ABCD` is a quadrilateral in a circle, its opposite angles are equal to two right angles. [elem.3.22]
But the angles `DBF`, `DBE` are also equal to two right angles; therefore the angles `DBF`, `DBE` are equal to the angles `BAD`, `BCD`,
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
