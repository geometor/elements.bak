> If two incommensurable magnitudes be added together, the whole will also be incommensurable with each of them; and, if the whole be incommensurable with one of them, the original magnitudes will also be incommensurable.

Proof:
For let the two incommensurable magnitudes > AB, > BC be added together; I say that the whole > AC is also incommensurable with each of the magnitudes > AB, > BC.
For, if > CA, > AB are not incommensurable, some magnitude will measure them.
Let it measure them, if possible, and let it be > D.
Since then > D measures > CA, > AB, therefore it will also measure the remainder > BC.
But it measures > AB also; therefore > D measures > AB, > BC.
Therefore > AB, > BC are commensurable; but they were also, by hypothesis, incommensurable: which is impossible.
Therefore no magnitude will measure > CA, > AB; therefore > CA, > AB are incommensurable. [elem.10.def.1]
Similarly we can prove that > AC, > CB are also incommensurable.
Therefore > AC is incommensurable with each of the magnitudes > AB, > BC.
Next, let > AC be incommensurable with one of the magnitudes > AB, > BC.
First, let it be incommensurable with > AB; I say that > AB, > BC are also incommensurable.
For, if they are commensurable, some magnitude will measure them.
Let it measure them, and let it be > D.
Since then > D measures > AB, > BC. therefore it will also measure the whole > AC.
But it measures > AB also; therefore > D measures > CA, > AB.
Therefore > CA, > AB are commensurable; but they were also, by hypothesis, incommensurable: which is impossible.
Therefore no magnitude will measure > AB, > BC; therefore > AB, > BC are incommensurable. [elem.10.def.1]
Therefore etc.
