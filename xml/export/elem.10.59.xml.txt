> If an area be contained by a rational straight line and the sixth binomial, the 
 of the area is the irrational straight line called the side of the sum of two medial areas.

Proof:
For let the area > ABCD be contained by the rational straight line > AB and the sixth binomial > AD, divided into its terms at > E, so that > AE is the greater term; I say that the 
 of > AC is the side of the sum of two medial areas.
Let the same construction be made as before shown.
It is then manifest that > MO is the 
 of > AC, and that > MN is incommensurable in square with > NO.
Now, since > EA is incommensurable in length with > AB, therefore > EA, > AB are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore > AK, that is, the sum of the squares on > MN, > NO, is medial. [elem.10.21]
Again, since > ED is incommensurable in length with > AB, therefore > FE is also incommensurable with > EK; [elem.10.13] therefore > FE, > EK are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore > EL, that is, > MR, that is, the rectangle > MN, > NO, is medial. [elem.10.21]
And, since > AE is incommensurable with > EF, > AK is also incommensurable with > EL. [elem.6.1, elem.10.11]
But > AK is the sum of the squares on > MN, > NO, and > EL is the rectangle > MN, > NO; therefore the sum of the squares on > MN, > NO is incommensurable with the rectangle > MN, > NO.
And each of them is medial, and > MN, > NO are incommensurable in square.
Therefore > MO is the side of the sum of two medial areas [elem.10.41], and is the 
 of > AC. Q. E. D.
