Enunciation:
`If on the circumference of a circle two points be taken at random`, `the straight line joining the points will fall within the circle`.

Proof:
Let `ABC` be a circle, and let two points `A`, `B` be taken at random on its circumference; I say that the straight line joined from `A` to `B` will fall within the circle.
For suppose it does not, but, if possible, let it fall outside, as `AEB`; let the centre of the circle `ABC` be taken [elem.3.1], and let it be `D`; let `DA`, `DB` be joined, and let `DFE` be drawn through.
Then, since `DA` is equal to `DB`, > the angle `DAE` is also equal to the angle `DBE`. [elem.1.5] And, since one side `AEB` of the triangle `DAE` is produced, > the angle `DEB` is greater than the angle `DAE`. [elem.1.16]
But the angle `DAE` is equal to the angle `DBE`; > therefore the angle `DEB` is greater than the angle `DBE`. And the greater angle is subtended by the greater side; [elem.1.19] > therefore `DB` is greater than `DE`. But `DB` is equal to `DF`;
       > therefore `DF` is greater than `DE`,
       > the less than the greater : which is impossible.
Therefore the straight line joined from `A` to `B` will not fall outside the circle.
Similarly we can prove that neither will it fall on the circumference itself; > therefore it will fall within.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
