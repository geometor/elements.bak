Enunciation:
`If there be any number of magnitudes whatever`, `and others equal to them in multitude`, `which taken two and two together are in the same ratio`, `they will also be in the same ratio` ex aequali.

Proof:
Let there be any number of magnitudes `A`, `B`, `C`, and others `D`, `E`, `F` equal to them in multitude, which taken two and two together are in the same ratio, so that, > as `A` is to `B`, so is `D` to `E`, and, as `B` is to `C`, so is `E` to `F`; I say that they will also be in the same ratio `ex aequali`, > <that is, as `A` is to `C`, so is `D` to `F`>.
For of `A`, `D` let equimultiples `G`, `H` be taken, and of `B`, `E` other, chance, equimultiples `K`, `L`; and, further, of `C`, `F` other, chance, equimultiples `M`, `N`.
Then, since, as `A` is to `B`, so is `D` to `E`, and of `A`, `D` equimultiples `G`, `H` have been taken, and of `B`, `E` other, chance, equimultiples `K`, `L`, > therefore, as `G` is to `K`, so is `H` to `L`. [elem.5.4]
For the same reason also, > as `K` is to `M`, so is `L` to `N`.
Since, then, there are three magnitudes `G`, `K`, `M`, and others `H`, `L`, `N` equal to them in multitude, which taken two and two together are in the same ratio, therefore, , if `G` is in excess of `M`, `H` is also in excess of `N`; if equal, equal; and if less, less. [elem.5.20]
And `G`, `H` are equimultiples of `A`, `D`, > and `M`, `N` other, chance, equimultiples of `C`, `F`.
Therefore, as `A` is to `C`, so is `D` to `F`. [elem.5.def.5]
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
