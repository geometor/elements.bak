In right-angled triangles the square on the side subtending the right angle is equal to the squares on the sides containing the right angle.

Proof:
Let `ABC` be a right-angled triangle having the angle `BAC` right;
I say that the square on `BC` is equal to the squares on `BA`, `AC`.
For let there be described on `BC` the square `BDEC`, and on `BA`, `AC` the squares `GB`, `HC`; [elem.1.46] through `A` let `AL` be drawn parallel to either `BD` or `CE`, and let `AD`, `FC` be joined.
Then, since each of the angles `BAC`, `BAG` is right, it follows that with a straight line `BA`, and at the point `A` on it, the two straight lines `AC`, `AG` not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles equal to two right angles; > therefore `CA` is in a straight line with `AG`. [elem.1.14]
For the same reason > `BA` is also in a straight line with `AH`.
And, since the angle `DBC` is equal to the angle `FBA`: for each is right: let the angle `ABC` be added to each; > therefore the whole angle `DBA` is equal to the whole angle `FBC`. [elem.1.c.n.2]
And, since `DB` is equal to `BC`, and `FB` to `BA`, the two sides `AB`, `BD` are equal to the two sides `FB`, `BC` respectively, > and the angle `ABD` is equal to the angle `FBC`; therefore the base `AD` is equal to the base `FC`, and the triangle `ABD` is equal to the triangle `FBC`. [elem.1.4]
Now the parallelogram `BL` is double of the triangle `ABD`, for they have the same base `BD` and are in the same parallels `BD`, `AL`. [elem.1.41]
And the square `GB` is double of the triangle `FBC`, for they again have the same base `FB` and are in the same parallels `FB`, `GC`. [elem.1.41]
[But the doubles of equals are equal to one another.] > Therefore the parallelogram `BL` is also equal to the square `GB`.
Similarly, if `AE`, `BK` be joined, the parallelogram `CL` can also be proved equal to the square `HC`; > therefore the whole square `BDEC` is equal to the two squares `GB`, `HC`. [elem.1.c.n.2]
And the square `BDEC` is described on `BC`, > and the squares `GB`, `HC` on `BA`, `AC`.
Therefore the square on the side `BC` is equal to the squares on the sides `BA`, `AC`.
Therefore etc.
