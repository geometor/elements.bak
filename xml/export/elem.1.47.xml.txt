In right-angled triangles the square on the side subtending the right angle is equal to the squares on the sides containing the right angle.

Proof:
Let `ABC` be a right-angled triangle having the angle `BAC` right;
I say that the square on `BC` is equal to the squares on `BA`, `AC`.
For let there be described on `BC` the square `BDEC`, `BA`, `AC` the squares `GB`, `HC`; [elem.1.46] through `A` let `AL` be drawn parallel to either `BD` or `CE`, and let `AD`, `FC` be joined.
Then, since each of the angles `BAC`, `BAG` is right, it follows that with a straight line `BA`, and at the point `A` on it, the two straight lines `AC`, `AG` not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles equal to two right angles;
For the same reason
And, since the angle `DBC` is equal to the angle `FBA`: for each is right: let the angle `ABC` be added to each;
And, since `DB` is equal to `BC`, and `FB` to `BA`, the two sides `AB`, `BD` are equal to the two sides `FB`, `BC` respectively,
Now the parallelogram `BL` is double of the triangle `ABD`, for they have the same base `BD` and are in the same parallels `BD`, `AL`. [elem.1.41]
And the square `GB` is double of the triangle `FBC`, for they again have the same base `FB` and are in the same parallels `FB`, `GC`. [elem.1.41]
[But the doubles of equals are equal to one another.]
Similarly, if `AE`, `BK` be joined, the parallelogram `CL` can also be proved equal to the square `HC`;
And the square `BDEC` is described on `BC`,
Therefore the square on the side `BC` is equal to the `BA`, `AC`.
Therefore etc.
