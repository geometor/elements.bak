Enunciation:
`If in a circle two straight lines cut one another which are not through the centre`, `they do not bisect one another`.

Proof:
Let `ABCD` be a circle, and in it let the two straight lines `AC`, `BD`, which are not through the centre, cut one another at `E`;  I say that they do not bisect one another.
For, if possible, let them bisect one another, so that `AE` is equal to `EC`, and `BE` to `ED`; let the centre of the circle `ABCD` be taken [elem.3.1], and let it be `F`; let `FE` be joined.
Then, since a straight line `FE` through the centre bisects a straight line `AC` not through the centre, > it also cuts it at right angles; [elem.3.3] therefore the angle `FEA` is right.
Again, since a straight line `FE` bisects a straight line `BD`, > it also cuts it at right angles; [elem.3.3] therefore the angle `FEB` is right.
But the angle `FEA` was also proved right; > therefore the angle `FEA` is equal to the angle `FEB`, the less to the greater: which is impossible.
Therefore `AC`, `BD` do not bisect one another.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
