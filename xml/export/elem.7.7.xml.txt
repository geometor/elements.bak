Enunciation:
> If a number be that part of a number, which a number subtracted is of a number subtracted, the remainder will also be the same part of the remainder that the whole is of the whole.

Proof:
For let the number > AB be that part of the number > CD which > AE subtracted is of > CF subtracted; I say that the remainder > EB is also the same part of the remainder > FD that the whole > AB is of the whole > CD.
For, whatever part > AE is of > CF, the same part also let > EB be of > CG.
Now since, whatever part > AE is of > CF, the same part also is > EB of > CG, therefore, whatever part > AE is of > CF, the same part also is > AB of > GF. [elem.7.5]
But, whatever part > AE is of > CF, the same part also, by hypothesis, is > AB of > CD; therefore, whatever part > AB is of > GF, the same part is it of > CD also; therefore > GF is equal to > CD.
Let > CF be subtracted from each; therefore the remainder > GC is equal to the remainder > FD.
Now since, whatever part > AE is of > CF, the same part also is > EB of > GC, while > GC is equal to > FD, therefore, whatever part > AE is of > CF, the same part also is > EB of > FD.
But, whatever part > AE is of > CF, the same part also is > AB of > CD; therefore also the remainder > EB is the same part of the remainder > FD that the whole > AB is of the whole > CD. Q. E. D.
