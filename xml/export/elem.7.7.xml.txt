Proof:
For let the number  be that part of the number  which  subtracted is of  subtracted; I say that the remainder  is also the same part of the remainder  that the whole  is of the whole .
For, whatever part  is of , the same part also let  be of .
Now since, whatever part  is of , the same part also is  of , therefore, whatever part  is of , the same part also is  of . [elem.7.5]
But, whatever part  is of , the same part also, by hypothesis, is  of ; therefore, whatever part  is of , the same part is it of  also; therefore  is equal to .
Let  be subtracted from each; therefore the remainder  is equal to the remainder .
Now since, whatever part  is of , the same part also is  of , while  is equal to , therefore, whatever part  is of , the same part also is  of .
But, whatever part  is of , the same part also is  of ;  is the same part of the remainder  that the whole  is of the whole . Q. E. D.
