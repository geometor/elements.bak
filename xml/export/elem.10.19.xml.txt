Enunciation:
> The rectangle contained by rational straight lines commensurable in length is rational.

Proof:
For let the rectangle > AC be contained by the rational straight lines > AB, > BC commensurable in length; I say that > AC is rational.
For on > AB let the square > AD be described; therefore > AD is rational. [elem.10.def.4]
And, since > AB is commensurable in length with > BC, while > AB is equal to > BD, therefore > BD is commensurable in length with > BC.
And, as > BD is to > BC, so is > DA to > AC. [elem.6.1]
Therefore > DA is commensurable with > AC. [elem.10.11]
But > DA is rational; therefore > AC is also rational. [elem.10.def.4]
Therefore etc.
