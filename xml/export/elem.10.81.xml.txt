> To a second apotome of a medial straight line only one medial straight line can be annexed which is commensurable with the whole in square only and which contains with the whole a medial rectangle.

Proof:
Let > AB be a second apotome of a medial straight line and > BC an annex to > AB; therefore > AC, > CB are medial straight lines commensurable in square only and such that the rectangle > AC, > CB which they contain is medial. [elem.10.75]
I say that no other medial straight line can be annexed to > AB which is commensurable with the whole in square only and which contains with the whole a medial rectangle.
For, if possible, let > BD also be so annexed; therefore > AD, > DB are also medial straight lines commensurable in square only and such that the rectangle > AD, > DB which they contain is medial. [elem.10.75]
Let a rational straight line > EF be set out, let > EG equal to the squares on > AC, > CB be applied to > EF, producing > EM as breadth, and let > HG equal to twice the rectangle > AC, > CB be subtracted, producing > HM as breadth; therefore the remainder > EL is equal to the square on > AB, [elem.2.7] so that > AB is the 
 of > EL.
Again, let > EI equal to the squares on > AD, > DB be applied to > EF, producing > EN as breadth.
But > EL is also equal to the square on > AB; therefore the remainder > HI is equal to twice the rectangle > AD, > DB. [elem.2.7]
Now, since > AC, > CB are medial straight lines, therefore the squares on > AC, > CB are also medial.
And they are equal to > EG; therefore > EG is also medial. [elem.10.15 elem.10.23.p.1]
And it is applied to the rational straight line > EF, producing > EM as breadth; therefore > EM is rational and incommensurable in length with > EF. [elem.10.22]
Again, since the rectangle > AC, > CB is medial, twice the rectangle > AC, > CB is also medial. [elem.10.23.p.1]
And it is equal to > HG; therefore > HG is also medial.
And it is applied to the rational straight line > EF, producing > HM as breadth; therefore > HM is also rational and incommensurable in length with > EF. [elem.10.22]
And, since > AC, > CB are commensurable in square only, therefore > AC is incommensurable in length with > CB.
But, as > AC is to > CB, so is the square on > AC to the rectangle > AC, > CB; therefore the square on > AC is incommensurable with the rectangle > AC, > CB. [elem.10.11]
But the squares on > AC, > CB are commensurable with the square on > AC, while twice the rectangle > AC, > CB is commensurable with the rectangle > AC, > CB; [elem.10.6] therefore the squares on > AC, > CB are incommensurable with twice the rectangle > AC, > CB. [elem.10.13]
And > EG is equal to the squares on > AC, > CB, while > GH is equal to twice the rectangle > AC, > CB; therefore > EG is incommensurable with > HG.
But, as > EG is to > HG, so is > EM to > HM; [elem.6.1] therefore > EM is incommensurable in length with > MH. [elem.10.11]
And both are rational; therefore > EM, > MH are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore > EH is an apotome, and > HM an annex to it. [elem.10.73]
Similarly we can prove that > HN is also an annex to it; therefore to an apotome different straight lines are annexed which are commensurable with the wholes in square only: which is impossible. [elem.10.79]
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
