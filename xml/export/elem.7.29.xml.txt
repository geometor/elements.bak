Enunciation:
> Any prime number is prime to any number which it does not measure.

Proof:
Let > A be a prime number, and let it not measure > B; I say that > B, > A are prime to one another.
For, if > B, > A are not prime to one another, some number will measure them.
Let > C measure them.
Since > C measures > B, and > A does not measure > B, therefore > C is not the same with > A.
Now, since > C measures > B, > A, therefore it also measures > A which is prime, though it is not the same with it: which is impossible.
Therefore no number will measure > B, > A.
Therefore > A, > B are prime to one another. Q. E. D.
