> If from an odd number an even number be subtracted, the remainder will be odd.

Proof:
For from the odd number > AB let the even number > BC be subtracted; I say that the remainder > CA is odd.
Let the unit > AD be subtracted; therefore > DB is even. [elem.7.def.7]
But > BC is also even; therefore the remainder > CD is even. [elem.9.24]
Therefore > CA is odd. [elem.7.def.7] Q. E. D.
