Enunciation:
`To a given straight line to apply a parallelogram equal to a given rectilineal figure and deficient by a parallelogrammic figure similar to a given one : thus the given rectilineal figure must not be greater than the parallelogram described on the half of the straight line and similar to the defect`.

Proof:
Let `AB` be the given straight line, `C` the given rectilineal figure to which the figure to be applied to `AB` is required to be equal, not being greater than the parallelogram described on the half of `AB` and similar to the defect, and `D` the parallelogram to which the defect is required to be similar; thus it is required to apply to the given straight line `AB` a parallelogram equal to the given rectilineal figure `C` and deficient by a parallelogrammic figure which is similar to `D`.
Let `AB` be bisected at the point `E`, and on `EB` let `EBFG` be described similar and similarly situated to `D`; [elem.6.18] let the parallelogram `AG` be completed.
If then `AG` is equal to `C`, that which was enjoined will have been done;
But, if not, let `HE` be greater than `C`.
Now `HE` is equal to `GB`;
Let `KLMN` be constructed at once equal to the excess by which `GB` is greater than `C` and similar and similarly situated to `D`. [elem.6.25]
But `D` is similar to `GB`;
Let, then, `KL` correspond to `GE`, and `LM` to `GF`.
Now, since `GB` is equal to `C`, `KM`,
Let `GO` be made equal to `KL`, and `GP` equal to `LM`; and let the parallelogram `OGPQ` be completed;
Therefore `GQ` is also similar to `GB`; [elem.6.21] therefore `GQ` is about the same diameter with `GB`. [elem.6.26]
Let `GQB` be their diameter, and let the figure be described.
Then, since `BG` is equal to `C`, `KM`, and in them `GQ` is equal to `KM`, therefore the remainder, the gnomon `UWV`, is equal to the remainder `C`.
And, since `PR` is equal to `OS`,  therefore the whole `PB` is equal to the whole `OB`.
But `OB` is equal to `TE`, since the side `AE` is also equal to the side `EB`; [elem.1.36]
Let `OS` be added to each;
But the gnomon `VWU` was proved equal to `C`;
Therefore to the given straight line `AB` there has been applied the parallelogram `ST` equal to the given rectilineal figure `C` and deficient by a parallelogrammic figure `QB` which is similar to `D`. Q. E. F.
