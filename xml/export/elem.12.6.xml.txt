Proof:
Let there be pyramids of the same height of which the polygons ,  are the bases and the points ,  the vertices; I say that, as the base  is to the base , so is the pyramid  to the pyramid .
For let , , ,  be joined.
Since then ,  are two pyramids which have triangular bases and equal height, they are to one another as the bases; [elem.12.5] therefore, as the base  is to the base , so is the pyramid  to the pyramid .
And, , as the base  is to the base , so is the pyramid  to the pyramid . [elem.5.18]
But also, as the base  is to the base , so is the pyramid  to the pyramid . [elem.12.5]
Therefore, , as the base  is to the base , so is the pyramid  to the pyramid . [elem.5.22]
And again , as the base  is to the base , so is the pyramid  to the pyramid . [elem.5.18]
Similarly also it can be proved that, as the base  is to the base , so is the pyramid  to the pyramid .
And, since ,  are two pyramids which have triangular bases and equal height, therefore, as the base  is to the base , so is the pyramid  to the pyramid . [elem.12.5]
But, as the base  is to the base , so was the pyramid  to the pyramid .
Therefore also, , as the base  is to the base , so is the pyramid  to the pyramid . [elem.5.22]
But further, as the base  is to the base , so also was the pyramid  to the pyramid .
Therefore also, , as the base  is to the base , so is the pyramid  to the pyramid . [elem.5.22] Q. E. D.
