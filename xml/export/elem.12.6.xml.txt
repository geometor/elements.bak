> Pyramids which are of the same height and have polygonal bases are to one another as the bases.

Proof:
Let there be pyramids of the same height of which the polygons > ABCDE, > FGHKL are the bases and the points > M, > N the vertices; I say that, as the base > ABCDE is to the base > FGHKL, so is the pyramid > ABCDEM to the pyramid > FGHKLN.
For let > AC, > AD, > FH, > FK be joined.
Since then > ABCM, > ACDM are two pyramids which have triangular bases and equal height, they are to one another as the bases; [elem.12.5] therefore, as the base > ABC is to the base > ACD, so is the pyramid > ABCM to the pyramid > ACDM.
And, , as the base > ABCD is to the base > ACD, so is the pyramid > ABCDM to the pyramid > ACDM. [elem.5.18]
But also, as the base > ACD is to the base > ADE, so is the pyramid > ACDM to the pyramid > ADEM. [elem.12.5]
Therefore, , as the base > ABCD is to the base > ADE, so is the pyramid > ABCDM to the pyramid > ADEM. [elem.5.22]
And again , as the base > ABCDE is to the base > ADE, so is the pyramid > ABCDEM to the pyramid > ADEM. [elem.5.18]
Similarly also it can be proved that, as the base > FGHKL is to the base > FGH, so is the pyramid > FGHKLN to the pyramid > FGHN.
And, since > ADEM, > FGHN are two pyramids which have triangular bases and equal height, therefore, as the base > ADE is to the base > FGH, so is the pyramid > ADEM to the pyramid > FGHN. [elem.12.5]
But, as the base > ADE is to the base > ABCDE, so was the pyramid > ADEM to the pyramid > ABCDEM.
Therefore also, , as the base > ABCDE is to the base > FGH, so is the pyramid > ABCDEM to the pyramid > FGHN. [elem.5.22]
But further, as the base > FGH is to the base > FGHKL, so also was the pyramid > FGHN to the pyramid > FGHKLN.
Therefore also, > ex aequali, as the base > ABCDE is to the base > FGHKL, so is the pyramid > ABCDEM to the pyramid > FGHKLN. [elem.5.22] Q. E. D.
