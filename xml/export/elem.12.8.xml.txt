Proof:
Let there be similar and similarly situated pyramids of , , are the bases and the points ,  the vertices; I say that the pyramid  has to the pyramid  the ratio triplicate of that which  has to .
For let the parallelepipedal solids ,  be completed.
Now, since the pyramid  is similar to the pyramid , therefore the angle  is equal to the angle , the angle  to the angle , and the angle  to the angle ; and, as  is to , so is  to , and  to .
And since, as  is to , so is  to , and the sides are proportional about equal angles, therefore the parallelogram  is similar to the parallelogram .
For the same reason  is also similar to , and  to ; therefore the three parallelograms , ,  are similar to the three , , .
But the three parallelograms , ,  are equal and similar to their three opposites, and the three , ,  are equal and similar to their three opposites. [elem.11.24]
Therefore the solids ,  are contained by similar planes equal in multitude.
Therefore the solid  is similar to the solid .
But similar parallelepipedal solids are in the triplicate ratio of their corresponding sides. [elem.11.33]
Therefore the solid  has to the solid  the ratio triplicate of that which the corresponding side  has to the corresponding side .
But, as the solid  is to the solid , so is the pyramid  to the pyramid , inasmuch as the pyramid is a sixth part of the solid, because the prism which is half of the parallelepipedal solid [elem.11.28] is also triple of the pyramid. [elem.12.7]
Therefore the pyramid  also has to the pyramid  the ratio triplicate of that which  has to . Q. E. D.
