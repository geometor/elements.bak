> Similar pyramids which have triangular bases are in the triplicate ratio of their corresponding sides.

Proof:
Let there be similar and similarly situated pyramids of which the triangles > ABC, > DEF, are the bases and the points > G, > H the vertices; I say that the pyramid > ABCG has to the pyramid > DEFH the ratio triplicate of that which > BC has to > EF.
For let the parallelepipedal solids > BGML, > EHQP be completed.
Now, since the pyramid > ABCG is similar to the pyramid > DEFH, therefore the angle > ABC is equal to the angle > DEF, the angle > GBC to the angle > HEF, and the angle > ABG to the angle > DEH; and, as > AB is to > DE, so is > BC to > EF, and > BG to > EH.
And since, as > AB is to > DE, so is > BC to > EF, and the sides are proportional about equal angles, therefore the parallelogram > BM is similar to the parallelogram > EQ.
For the same reason > BN is also similar to > ER, and > BK to > EO; therefore the three parallelograms > MB, > BK, > BN are similar to the three > EQ, > EO, > ER.
But the three parallelograms > MB, > BK, > BN are equal and similar to their three opposites, and the three > EQ, > EO, > ER are equal and similar to their three opposites. [elem.11.24]
Therefore the solids > BGML, > EHQP are contained by similar planes equal in multitude.
Therefore the solid > BGML is similar to the solid > EHQP.
But similar parallelepipedal solids are in the triplicate ratio of their corresponding sides. [elem.11.33]
Therefore the solid > BGML has to the solid > EHQP the ratio triplicate of that which the corresponding side > BC has to the corresponding side > EF.
But, as the solid > BGML is to the solid > EHQP, so is the pyramid > ABCG to the pyramid > DEFH, inasmuch as the pyramid is a sixth part of the solid, because the prism which is half of the parallelepipedal solid [elem.11.28] is also triple of the pyramid. [elem.12.7]
Therefore the pyramid > ABCG also has to the pyramid > DEFH the ratio triplicate of that which > BC has to > EF. Q. E. D.
