> To find the third apotome.

Proof:
Let a rational straight line > A be set out, let three numbers > E, > BC, > CD be set out which have not to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number, but let > CB have to > BD the ratio which a square number has to a square number.
Let it be contrived that, as > E is to > BC, so is the square on > A to the square on > FG, and, as > BC is to > CD, so is the square on > FG to the square on > GH. [elem.10.6.p.1]
Since then, as > E is to > BC, so is the square on > A to the square on > FG, therefore the square on > A is commensurable with the square on > FG. [elem.10.6]
But the square on > A is rational; therefore the square on > FG is also rational; therefore > FG is rational.
And, since > E has not to > BC the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore neither has the square on > A to the square on > FG the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore > A is incommensurable in length with > FG. [elem.10.9]
Again, since, as > BC is to > CD, so is the square on > FG to the square on > GH, therefore the square on > FG is commensurable with the square on > GH. [elem.10.6]
But the square on > FG is rational; therefore the square on > GH is also rational; therefore > GH is rational.
And, since > BC has not to > CD the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore neither has the square on > FG to the square on > GH the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore > FG is incommensurable in length with > GH. [elem.10.9]
And both are rational; therefore > FG, > GH are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore > FH is an apotome. [elem.10.73]
I say next that it is also a third apotome.
For since, as > E is to > BC, so is the square on > A to the square on > FG, and, as > BC is to > CD, so is the square on > FG to the square on > HG, therefore, > ex aequali, as > E is to > CD, so is the square on > A to the square on > HG. [elem.5.22]
But > E has not to > CD the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore neither has the square on > A to the square on > GH the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore > A is incommensurable in length with > GH. [elem.10.9]
Therefore neither of the straight lines > FG, > GH is commensurable in length with the rational straight line > A set out.
Now let the square on > K be that by which the square on > FG is greater than the square on > GH.
Since then, as > BC is to > CD, so is the square on > FG to the square on > GH, therefore, , as > BC is to > BD, so is the square on > FG to the square on > K. [elem.5.19.p.1]
But > BC has to > BD the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore the square on > FG also has to the square on > K the ratio which a square number has to a square number.
Therefore > FG is commensurable in length with > K, [elem.10.9] and the square on > FG is greater than the square on > GH by the square on a straight line commensurable with > FG.
And neither of the straight lines > FG, > GH is commensurable in length with the rational straight line > A set out; therefore > FH is a third apotome. [elem.10.def.3.3]
Therefore the third apotome > FH has been found. Q. E. D.
