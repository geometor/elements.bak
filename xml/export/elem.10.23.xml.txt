Proof:
Let  be medial, and let  be commensurable with ; I say that  is also medial.
For let a rational straight line  be set out,  let the rectangular area  equal to the square on  be applied, producing  as breadth; therefore  is rational and incommensurable in length with . [elem.10.22]
And let the rectangular area  equal to the square on  be applied to , producing  as breadth.
Since then  is commensurable with , the square on  is also commensurable with the square on .
But  is equal to the square on , and  is equal to the square on ; therefore  is commensurable with .
And, as  is to , so is  to ; [elem.6.1] therefore  is commensurable in length with . [elem.10.11]
But  is rational and incommensurable in length with ; therefore  is also rational [elem.10.def.3] and incommensurable in length with . [elem.10.13]
Therefore ,  are rational and commensurable in square only.
But the straight line the square on which is equal to the rectangle contained by rational straight lines commensurable in square only is medial; [elem.10.21] therefore the side of the square equal to the rectangle ,  is medial.
And  is the side of the square equal to the rectangle , ; therefore  is medial.
