Enunciation:
> A straight line commensurable with a medial straight line is medial.

Proof:
Let > A be medial, and let > B be commensurable with > A; I say that > B is also medial.
For let a rational straight line > CD be set out,  and to > CD let the rectangular area > CE equal to the square on > A be applied, producing > ED as breadth; therefore > ED is rational and incommensurable in length with > CD. [elem.10.22]
And let the rectangular area > CF equal to the square on > B be applied to > CD, producing > DF as breadth.
Since then > A is commensurable with > B, the square on > A is also commensurable with the square on > B.
But > EC is equal to the square on > A, and > CF is equal to the square on > B; therefore > EC is commensurable with > CF.
And, as > EC is to > CF, so is > ED to > DF; [elem.6.1] therefore > ED is commensurable in length with > DF. [elem.10.11]
But > ED is rational and incommensurable in length with > DC; therefore > DF is also rational [elem.10.def.3] and incommensurable in length with > DC. [elem.10.13]
Therefore > CD, > DF are rational and commensurable in square only.
But the straight line the square on which is equal to the rectangle contained by rational straight lines commensurable in square only is medial; [elem.10.21] therefore the side of the square equal to the rectangle > CD, > DF is medial.
And > B is the side of the square equal to the rectangle > CD, > DF; therefore > B is medial.
