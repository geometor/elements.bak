Enunciation:
`In a circle the angle in the semicircle is right`, `that in a greater segment less than a right angle`, `and that in a less segment greater than a right angle; and further the angle of the greater segment is greater than a right angle`, `and the angle of the less segment less than a right angle`.

Proof:
Let `ABCD` be a circle, let `BC` be its diameter, and `E` its centre, and let `BA`, `AC`, `AD`, `DC` be joined; I say that the angle `BAC` in the semicircle `BAC` is right, the angle `ABC` in the segment `ABC` greater than the semicircle is less `ADC` in the segment `ADC` less than the semicircle is greater than a right angle.
Let `AE` be joined, and let `BA` be carried through to `F`.
Then, since `BE` is equal to `EA`,
Again, since `CE` is equal to `EA`,
Therefore the whole angle `BAC` is equal to the two angles `ABC`, `ACB`.
But the angle `FAC` exterior to the triangle `ABC` is also equal to the two angles `ABC`, `ACB`; [elem.1.32]
Next, since in the triangle `ABC` the two angles `ABC`, `BAC` are less than two right angles, [elem.1.17] and the angle `BAC` is a right angle,  and it is the angle in the segment `ABC` greater than the semicircle.
Next, since `ABCD` is a quadrilateral in a circle, and the opposite angles of quadrilaterals in circles are equal to two right angles, [elem.3.22] while the angle `ABC` is less than a right angle, therefore the angle `ADC` which remains is greater than a right angle; and it is the angle in the segment `ADC` less than the semicircle.
I say further that the angle of the greater segment, namely that contained by the circumference `ABC` and the straight line `AC`, is greater than a right angle; and the angle of the less segment, namely that contained by the circumference `ADC` and the straight line `AC`, is less than a right angle.
This is at once manifest. For, since the angle contained by the straight lines `BA`, `AC` is right,
Again, since the angle contained by the straight lines `AC`, `AF` is right,
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
