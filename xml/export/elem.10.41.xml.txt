Proof:
For let two straight lines ,  incommensurable in square and satisfying the given conditions [elem.10.35
] be added together; I say that  is irrational.
Let a rational straight line  be set out, and let there be applied to  the rectangle  equal to the squares on , , and the rectangle  equal to twice the rectangle , ; therefore the whole  is equal to the square on . [elem.2.4
]
Now, since the sum of the squares on ,  is medial, and is equal to , therefore  is also medial.
And it is applied to the rational straight line ; therefore  is rational and incommensurable in length with . [elem.10.22
]
For the same reason  is also rational and incommensurable in length with , that is, .
And, since the squares on ,  are incommensurable with twice the rectangle , ,  is incommensurable with ; so that  is also incommensurable with . [elem.6.1
, elem.10.11
]
And they are rational; therefore ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore  is irrational and what is called binomial. [elem.10.36
]
But  is rational; therefore  is irrational, and the side of the square which is equal to it is irrational. [elem.10.def.4
]
But  is the side of the square equal to ; therefore  is irrational.
And let it be called the . Q. E. D.
