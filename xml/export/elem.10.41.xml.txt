Proof:
For let two straight lines > AB, > BC incommensurable in square and satisfying the given conditions [elem.10.35
] be added together; I say that > AC is irrational.
Let a rational straight line > DE be set out, and let there be applied to > DE the rectangle > DF equal to the squares on > AB, > BC, and the rectangle > GH equal to twice the rectangle > AB, > BC; therefore the whole > DH is equal to the square on > AC. [elem.2.4
]
Now, since the sum of the squares on > AB, > BC is medial, and is equal to > DF, therefore > DF is also medial.
And it is applied to the rational straight line > DE; therefore > DG is rational and incommensurable in length with > DE. [elem.10.22
]
For the same reason > GK is also rational and incommensurable in length with > GF, that is, > DE.
And, since the squares on > AB, > BC are incommensurable with twice the rectangle > AB, > BC, > DF is incommensurable with > GH; so that > DG is also incommensurable with > GK. [elem.6.1
, elem.10.11
]
And they are rational; therefore > DG, > GK are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore > DK is irrational and what is called binomial. [elem.10.36
]
But > DE is rational; therefore > DH is irrational, and the side of the square which is equal to it is irrational. [elem.10.def.4
]
But > AC is the side of the square equal to > HD; therefore > AC is irrational.
And let it be called the > side of the sum of two medial areas. Q. E. D.
