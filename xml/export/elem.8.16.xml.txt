Enunciation:
> If a square number do not measure a square number, neither will the side measure the side; and, if the side do not measure the side, neither will the square measure the square.

Proof:
Let > A, > B be square numbers, and let > C, > D be their sides; and let > A not measure > B; I say that neither does > C measure > D.
For, if > C measures > D, > A will also measure > B. [elem.8.14]
But > A does not measure > B; therefore neither will > C measure > D.
Again, let > C not measure > D; I say that neither will > A measure > B.
For, if > A measures > B, > C will also measure > D. [elem.8.14]
But > C does not measure > D; therefore neither will > A measure > B. Q. E. D.
