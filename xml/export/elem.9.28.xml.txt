Enunciation:
> If an odd number by multiplying an even number make some number, the product will be even.

Proof:
For let the odd number > A by multiplying the even number > B make > C; I say that > C is even.
For, since > A by multiplying > B has made > C, therefore > C is made up of as many numbers equal to > B as there are units in > A. [elem.7.def.15]
And > B is even; therefore > C is made up of even numbers.
But, if as many even numbers as we please be added together, the whole is even. [elem.9.21]
Therefore > C is even. Q. E. D.
