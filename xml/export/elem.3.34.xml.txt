Enunciation:
`From a given circle to cut off a segment admitting an angle equal to a given rectilineal angle`.

Proof:
Let `ABC` be the given circle, and the angle at `D` the given rectilineal angle; thus it is required to cut off from the circle `ABC` a segment admitting an angle equal to the given rectilineal angle, the angle at `D`.
Let `EF` be drawn touching `ABC` at the point `B`, and on the straight line `FB`, and at the point `B` on it, let the angle `FBC` be constructed equal to the angle at `D`. [elem.1.23]
Then, since a straight line `EF` touches the circle `ABC`, > and `BC` has been drawn across from the point of contact at `B`, the angle `FBC` is equal to the angle constructed in the alternate segment `BAC`. [elem.3.32]
But the angle `FBC` is equal to the angle at `D`; > therefore the angle in the segment `BAC` is equal to the angle at `D`.
Therefore from the given circle `ABC` the segment `BAC`. has been cut off admitting an angle equal to the given rectilineal angle, the angle at `D`. Q. E. F.
