> If from an odd number an odd number be subtracted, the remainder will be even.

Proof:
For from the odd number > AB let the odd number > BC be subtracted; I say that the remainder > CA is even.
For, since > AB is odd, let the unit > BD be subtracted; therefore the remainder > AD is even. [elem.7.def.7]
For the same reason > CD is also even; [elem.7.def.7] so that the remainder > CA is also even. [elem.9.24] Q. E. D.
