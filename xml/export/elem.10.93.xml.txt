> If an area be contained by a rational straight line and a third apotome, the 
 of the area is a second apotome of a medial straight line.

Proof:
For let the area > AB be contained by the rational straight line > AC and the third apotome > AD; I say that the 
 of the area > AB is a second apotome of a medial straight line.
For let > DG be the annex to > AD; therefore > AG, > GD are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, and neither of the straight lines > AG, > GD is commensurable in length with the rational straight line > AC set out, while the square on the whole > AG is greater than the square on the annex > DG by the square on a straight line commensurable with > AG. [elem.10.def.3.3]
Since then the square on > AG is greater than the square on > GD by the square on a straight line commensurable with > AG, therefore, if there be applied to > AG a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on > DG and deficient by a square figure, it will divide it into commensurable parts. [elem.10.17]
Let then > DG be bisected at > E, let there be applied to > AG a parallelogram equal to the square on > EG and deficient by a square figure, and let it be the rectangle > AF, > FG.
Let > EH, > FI, > GK be drawn through the points > E, > F, > G parallel to > AC.
Therefore > AF, > FG are commensurable; therefore > AI is also commensurable with > FK. [elem.6.1, elem.10.11]
And, since > AF, > FG are commensurable in length, therefore > AG is also commensurable in length with each of the straight lines > AF, > FG. [elem.10.15]
But > AG is rational and incommensurable in length with > AC; so that > AF, > FG are so also. [elem.10.13]
Therefore each of the rectangles > AI, > FK is medial. [elem.10.21]
Again, since > DE is commensurable in length with > EG, therefore > DG is also commensurable in length with each of the straight lines > DE, > EG. [elem.10.15]
But > GD is rational and incommensurable in length with > AC; therefore each of the straight lines > DE, > EG is also rational and incommensurable in length with > AC; [elem.10.13] therefore each of the rectangles > DH, > EK is medial. [elem.10.21]
And, since > AG, > GD are commensurable in square only, therefore > AG is incommensurable in length with > GD.
But > AG is commensurable in length with > AF, and > DG with > EG; therefore > AF is incommensurable in length with > EG. [elem.10.13]
But, as > AF is to > EG, so is > AI to > EK; [elem.6.1] therefore > AI is incommensurable with > EK. [elem.10.11]
Now let the square > LM be constructed equal to > AI, and let there be subtracted > NO equal to > FK and being about the same angle with > LM; therefore > LM, > NO are about the same diameter. [elem.6.26]
Let > PR be their diameter, and let the figure be drawn.
Now, since the rectangle > AF, > FG is equal to the square on > EG, therefore, as > AF is to > EG, so is > EG to > FG. [elem.6.17]
But, as > AF is to > EG, so is > AI to > EK, and, as > EG is to > FG, so is > EK to > FK; [elem.6.1] therefore also, as > AI is to > EK, so is > EK to > FK; [elem.5.11] therefore > EK is a mean proportional between > AI, > FK.
But > MN is also a mean proportional between the squares > LM, > NO, and > AI is equal to > LM, and > FK to > NO; therefore > EK is also equal to > MN.
But > MN is equal to > LO, and > EK equal to > DH; therefore the whole > DK is also equal to the gnomon > UVW and > NO.
But > AK is also equal to > LM, > NO; therefore the remainder > AB is equal to > ST, that is, to the square on > LN; therefore > LN is the 
 of the area > AB.
I say that > LN is a second apotome of a medial straight line.
For, since > AI, > FK were proved medial, and are equal to the squares on > LP, > PN, therefore each of the squares on > LP, > PN is also medial; therefore each of the straight lines > LP, > PN is medial.
And, since > AI is commensurable with > FK, [elem.6.1, elem.10.11] therefore the square on > LP is also commensurable with the square on > PN.
Again, since > AI was proved incommensurable with > EK, therefore > LM is also incommensurable with > MN, that is, the square on > LP with the rectangle > LP, > PN; so that > LP is also incommensurable in length with > PN; [elem.6.1, elem.10.11] therefore > LP, > PN are medial straight lines commensurable in square only.
I say next that they also contain a medial rectangle.
For, since > EK was proved medial, and is equal to the rectangle > LP, > PN, therefore the rectangle > LP, > PN is also medial, so that > LP, > PN are medial straight lines commensurable in square only which contain a medial rectangle.
Therefore > LN is a second apotome of a medial straight line; [elem.10.75] and it is the 
 of the area > AB.
Therefore the 
 of the area > AB is a second apotome of a medial straight line. Q. E. D.
