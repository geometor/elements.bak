Enunciation:


Proof:
Let  be a composite number; I say that  is measured by some prime number.
For, since  is composite,
Let a number measure it, and let it be .
Now, if  is prime, what was enjoined will have been done.
But if it is composite, some number will measure it.
Let a number measure it, and let it be .
Then, since  measures , and  measures , therefore  also measures .
And, if  is prime, what was enjoined will have been done.
But if it is composite, some number will measure it.
Thus, if the investigation be continued in this way, some prime number will be found which will measure the number .
For, if it is not found, an infinite series of numbers will measure the number , each of which is less than the other: which is impossible in numbers.
Therefore some prime number will be found which will .
Therefore any composite number is measured by some prime number.
