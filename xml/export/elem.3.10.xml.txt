Enunciation:
`A circle does not cut a circle at more points than two`.

Proof:
For, if possible, let the circle `ABC` cut the circle `DEF` at more points than two, namely `B`, `C`, `F`, `H`;
let `BH`, `BG` be joined and bisected at the points `K`, `L`, and from `K`, `L` let `KC`, `LM` be drawn at right angles to `BH`, `BG` and carried through to the points `A`, `E`.
Then, since in the circle `ABC` a straight line `AC` cuts a straight line `BH` into two equal parts and at right angles, > the centre of the circle `ABC` is on `AC`. [elem.3.1.p.1]
Again, since in the same circle `ABC` a straight line `NO` cuts a straight line `BG` into two equal parts and at right angles, > the centre of the circle `ABC` is on `NO`.
But it was also proved to be on `AC`, and the straight lines `AC`, `NO` meet at no point except at `P`; > therefore the point `P` is the centre of the circle `ABC`.
Similarly we can prove that `P` is also the centre of the circle `DEF`; > therefore the two circles `ABC`, `DEF` which cut one another have the same centre `P`: which is impossible. [elem.3.5]
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
