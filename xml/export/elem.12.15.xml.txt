> In equal cones and cylinders the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights; and those cones and cylinders in which the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights are equal.

Proof:
Let there be equal cones and cylinders of which the circles > ABCD, > EFGH are the bases; let > AC, > EG be the diameters of the bases, and > KL, > MN the axes, which are also the heights of the cones or cylinders; let the cylinders > AO, > EP be completed.
I say that in the cylinders > AO, > EP the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights, that is, as the base > ABCD is to the base > EFGH, so is the height > MN to the height > KL.
For the height > LK is either equal to the height > MN or not equal.
First, let it be equal.
Now the cylinder > AO is also equal to the cylinder > EP.
But cones and cylinders which are of the same height are to one another as their bases; [elem.12.11] therefore the base > ABCD is also equal to the base > EFGH.
Hence also, reciprocally, as the base > ABCD is to the base > EFGH, so is the height > MN to the height > KL.
Next, let the height > LK not be equal to > MN, but let > MN be greater; from the height > MN let > QN be cut off equal to > KL, through the point > Q let the cylinder > EP be cut by the plane > TUS parallel to the planes of the circles > EFGH, > RP, and let the cylinder > ES be conceived erected from the circle > EFGH as base and with height > NQ.
Now, since the cylinder > AO is equal to the cylinder > EP, therefore, as the cylinder > AO is to the cylinder > ES, so is the cylinder > EP to the cylinder > ES. [elem.5.7]
But, as the cylinder > AO is to the cylinder > ES, so is the base > ABCD to the base > EFGH, for the cylinders > AO, > ES are of the same height; [elem.12.11] and, as the cylinder > EP is to the cylinder > ES, so is the height > MN to the height > QN, for the cylinder > EP has been cut by a plane which is parallel to its opposite planes. [elem.12.13]
Therefore also, as the base > ABCD is to the base > EFGH, so is the height > MN to the height > QN. [elem.5.11]
But the height > QN is equal to the height > KL; therefore, as the base > ABCD is to the base > EFGH, so is the height > MN to the height > KL.
Therefore in the cylinders > AO, > EP the bases are reciprocally proportional to the heights.
Next, in the cylinders > AO, > EP let the bases be reciprocally proportional to the heights, that is, as the base > ABCD is to the base > EFGH, so let the height > MN be to the height > KL; I say that the cylinder > AO is equal to the cylinder > EP.
For, with the same construction, since, as the base > ABCD is to the base > EFGH, so is the height > MN to the height > KL, while the height > KL is equal to the height > QN, therefore, as the base > ABCD is to the base > EFGH, so is the height > MN to the height > QN
But, as the base > ABCD is to the base > EFGH, so is the cylinder > AO to the cylinder > ES, for they are of the same height; [elem.12.11] and, as the height > MN is to > QN, so is the cylinder > EP to the cylinder > ES; [elem.12.13] therefore, as the cylinder > AO is to the cylinder > ES, so is the cylinder > EP to the cylinder > ES. [elem.5.11]
Therefore the cylinder > AO is equal to the cylinder > EP. [elem.5.9]
And the same is true for the cones also. Q. E. D.
