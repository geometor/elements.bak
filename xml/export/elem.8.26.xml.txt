Proof:
Let ,  be similar plane numbers; I say that  has to  the ratio which a square number has to a square number.
For, since ,  are similar plane numbers, therefore one mean proportional number falls between , . [elem.8.18]
Let it so fall, and let it be ; and let , , , the least numbers of those which have the same ratio with , , , be taken; [elem.7.33 or elem.8.2] therefore the extremes of them ,  are square. [elem.8.2.p.1]
And since, as  is to , so is  to , and ,  are square, therefore  has to  the ratio which a square number has to a square number. Q. E. D.
