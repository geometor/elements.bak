Enunciation:
> If four numbers be in continued proportion, and the first be cube, the fourth will also be cube.

Proof:
Let > A, > B, > C, > D be four numbers in continued proportion, and let > A be cube; I say that > D is also cube.
For, since between > A, > D there are two mean proportional numbers > B, > C, therefore > A, > D are similar solid numbers. [elem.8.21]
But > A is cube; therefore > D is also cube. Q. E. D.
