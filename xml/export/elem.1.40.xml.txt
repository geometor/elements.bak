Enunciation:
`Equal triangles which are on equal bases and on the same side are also in the same parallels`.

Proof:
Let `ABC`, `CDE` be equal triangles on equal bases `BC`, `CE` and on the same side.
I say that they are also in the same parallels.
For let `AD` be joined; I say that `AD` is parallel to `BE`.
For, if not, let `AF` be drawn through `A` parallel to `BE` [elem.1.31], and let `FE` be joined.
Therefore the triangle `ABC` is equal to the triangle `FCE`; for they are on equal bases `BC`, `CE` and in the same parallels `BE`, `AF`. [elem.1.38]
But the triangle `ABC` is equal to the triangle `DCE`; > therefore the triangle `DCE` is also equal to the triangle `FCE`, [elem.1.c.n.1] the greater to the less: which is impossible. Therefore `AF` is not parallel to `BE`.
Similarly we can prove that neither is any other straight line except `AD`; > therefore `AD` is parallel to `BE`.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.]
