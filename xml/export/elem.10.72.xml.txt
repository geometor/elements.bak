> If two medial areas incommensurable with one another be added together, the remaining two irrational straight lines arise, namely either a second bimedial or a side of the sum of two medial areas.

Proof:
For let two medial areas > AB, > CD incommensurable with one another be added together; I say that the 
 of the area > AD is either a second bimedial or a side of the sum of two medial areas.
For > AB is either greater or less than > CD.
First, if it so chance, let > AB be greater than > CD.
Let the rational straight line > EF be set out, and to > EF let there be applied the rectangle > EG equal to > AB and producing > EH as breadth, and the rectangle > HI equal to > CD and producing > HK as breadth.
Now, since each of the areas > AB, > CD is medial, therefore each of the areas > EG, > HI is also medial.
And they are applied to the rational straight line > FE, producing > EH, > HK as breadth; therefore each of the straight lines > EH, > HK is rational and incommensurable in length with > EF. [elem.10.22]
And, since > AB is incommensurable with > CD, and > AB is equal to > EG, and > CD to > HI, therefore > EG is also incommensurable with > HI.
But, as > EG is to > HI, so is > EH to > HK; [elem.6.1] therefore > EH is incommensurable in length with > HK. [elem.10.11]
Therefore > EH, > HK are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore > EK is binomial. [elem.10.36]
But the square on > EH is greater than the square on > HK either by the square on a straight line commensurable with > EH or by the square on a straight line incommensurable with it.
First, let the square on it be greater by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with itself.
Now neither of the straight lines > EH, > HK is commensurable in length with the rational straight line > EF set out; therefore > EK is a third binomial. [elem.10.def.2.3]
But > EF is rational; and, if an area be contained by a rational straight line and the third binomial, the 
 of the area is a second bimedial; [elem.10.56] therefore the 
 of > EI, that is, of > AD, is a second bimedial.
Next, let the square on > EH be greater than the square on > HK by the square on a straight line incommensurable in length with > EH.
Now each of the straight lines > EH, > HK is incommensurable in length with > EF; therefore > EK is a sixth binomial. [elem.10.def.2.6]
But, if an area be contained by a rational straight line and the sixth binomial, the 
 of the area is the side of the sum of two medial areas; [elem.10.59] so that the 
 of the area > AD is also the side of the sum of two medial areas.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
