> If an area be contained by a rational straight line and the third binomial, the 
 of the area is the irrational straight line called a second bimedial.

Proof:
For let the area > ABCD be contained by the rational straight line > AB and the third binomial > AD divided into its terms at > E, of which terms > AE is the greater; I say that the 
 of the area > AC is the irrational straight line called a second bimedial.
For let the same construction be made as before.
Now, since > AD is a third binomial straight line, therefore > AE, > ED are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, the square on > AE is greater than the square on > ED by the square on a straight line commensurable with > AE, and neither of the terms > AE, > ED is commensurable in length with > AB. [elem.10.def.2.3]
Then, in manner similar to the foregoing, we shall prove that > MO is the 
 of the area > AC, and > MN, > NO are medial straight lines commensurable in square only; so that > MO is bimedial.
It is next to be proved that it is also a second bimedial straight line.
Since > DE is incommensurable in length with > AB, that is, with > EK, and > DE is commensurable with > EF, therefore > EF is incommensurable in length with > EK. [elem.10.13]
And they are rational; therefore > FE, > EK are rational straight lines commensurable in square only.
Therefore > EL, that is, > MR, is medial. [elem.10.21]
And it is contained by > MN, > NO; therefore the rectangle > MN, > NO is medial.
Therefore > MO is a second bimedial straight line. [elem.10.38] Q. E. D.
