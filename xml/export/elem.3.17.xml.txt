Enunciation:
`From a given point to draw a straight line touching a given circle`.

Proof:
Let `A` be the given point, and `BCD` the given circle; thus it is required to draw from the point `A` a straight line touching the circle `BCD`.
For let the centre `E` of the circle be taken; [elem.3.1] let `AE` be joined, and with centre `E` and distance `EA` let the circle `AFG` be described;  from `D` let `DF` be drawn at right angles to `EA`, and let `EF`, `AB` be joined; I say that `AB` has been drawn from the point `A` touching the circle `BCD`.
For, since `E` is the centre of the circles `BCD`, `AFG`,  therefore the two sides `AE`, `EB` are equal to the two sides `FE`, `ED`: and they contain a common angle, the angle at `E`;
But the angle `EDF` is right;
Now `EB` is a radius; and the straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter of a circle, from its extremity, touches the circle; [elem.3.16.p.1]
Therefore from the given point `A` the straight line `AB` has been drawn touching the circle `BCD`.
