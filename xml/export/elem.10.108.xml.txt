> If from a rational area a medial area be subtracted, the 
 of the remaining area becomes one of two irrational straight lines, either an apotome or a minor straight line.

Proof:
For from the rational area > BC let the medial area > BD be subtracted; I say that the 
 of the remainder > EC becomes one of two irrational straight lines, either an apotome or a minor straight line.
For let a rational straight line > FG be set out, to > FG let there be applied the rectangular parallelogram > GH equal to > BC, and let > GK equal to > DB be subtracted; therefore the remainder > EC is equal to > LH.
Since then > BC is rational, and > BD medial, while > BC is equal to > GH, and > BD to > GK, therefore > GH is rational, and > GK medial.
And they are applied to the rational straight line > FG; therefore > FH is rational and commensurable in length with > FG, [elem.10.20] while > FK is rational and incommensurable in length with > FG; [elem.10.22] therefore > FH is incommensurable in length with > FK. [elem.10.13]
Therefore > FH, > FK are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore > KH is an apotome [elem.10.73], and > KF the annex to it.
Now the square on > HF is greater than the square on > FK by the square on a straight line either commensurable with > HF or not commensurable.
First, let the square on it be greater by the square on a straight line commensurable with it.
Now the whole > HF is commensurable in length with the rational straight line > FG set out; therefore > KH is a first apotome. [elem.10.def.3.1]
But the 
 of the rectangle contained by a rational straight line and a first apotome is an apotome. [elem.10.91]
Therefore the 
 of > LH, that is, of > EC, is an apotome.
But, if the square on > HF is greater than the square on > FK by the square on a straight line incommensurable with > HF, while the whole > FH is commensurable in length with the rational straight line > FG set out, > KH is a fourth apotome. [elem.10.def.3.4]
But the 
 of the rectangle contained by a rational straight line and a fourth apotome is minor. [elem.10.94] Q. E. D.
