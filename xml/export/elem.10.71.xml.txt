> If a rational and a medial area be added together, four irrational straight lines arise, namely a binomial or a first bimedial or a major or a side of a rational plus a medial area.

Proof:
Let. > AB be rational, and > CD medial; I say that the 
 of the area > AD is a binomial or a first bimedial or a major or a side of a rational plus a medial area.
For > AB is either greater or less than > CD.
First, let it be greater; let a rational straight line > EF be set out, let there be applied to > EF the rectangle > EG equal to > AB, producing > EH as breadth, and let > HI, equal to > DC, be applied to > EF, producing > HK as breadth.
Then, since > AB is rational and is equal to > EG, therefore > EG is also rational.
And it has been applied to > EF, producing > EH as breadth; therefore > EH is rational and commensurable in length with > EF. [elem.10.20]
Again, since > CD is medial and is equal to > HI, therefore > HI is also medial.
And it is applied to the rational straight line > EF, producing > HK as breadth; therefore > HK is rational and incommensurable in length with > EF [elem.10.22]
And, since > CD is medial, while > AB is rational, therefore > AB is incommensurable with > CD, so that > EG is also incommensurable with > HI.
But, as > EG is to > HI, so is > EH to > HK; [elem.6.1] therefore > EH is also incommensurable in length with > HK. [elem.10.11]
And both are rational; therefore > EH, > HK are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore > EK is a binomial straight line, divided at > H. [elem.10.36]
And, since > AB is greater than > CD, while > AB is equal to > EG and > CD to > HI, therefore > EG is also greater than > HI; therefore > EH is also greater than > HK.
The square, then, on > EH is greater than the square on > HK either by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with > EH or by the square on a straight line incommensurable with it.
First, let the square on it be greater by the square on a straight line commensurable with itself.
Now the greater straight line > HE is commensurable in length with the rational straight line > EF set out; therefore > EK is a first binomial. [elem.10.def.2.1]
But > EF is rational; and, if an area be contained by a rational straight line and the first binomial, the side of the square equal to the area is binomial. [elem.10.54]
Therefore the 
 of > EI is binomial; so that the 
 of > AD is also binomial.
Next, let the square on > EH be greater than the square on > HK by the square on a straight line incommensurable with > EH.
Now the greater straight line > EH is commensurable in length with the rational straight line > EF set out; therefore > EK is a fourth binomial. [elem.10.def.2.4]
But > EF is rational; and, if an area be contained by a rational straight line and the fourth binomial, the 
 of the area is the irrational straight line called major. [elem.10.57]
Therefore the 
 of the area > EI is major; so that the 
 of the area > AD is also major.
Next, let > AB be less than > CD; therefore > EG is also less than > HI, so that > EH is also less than > HK.
Now the square on > HK is greater than the square on > EH either by the square on a straight line commensurable with > HK or by the square on a straight line incommensurable with it.
First, let the square on it be greater by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with itself.
Now the lesser straight line > EH is commensurable in length with the rational straight line > EF set out; therefore > EK is a second binomial. [elem.10.def.2.2]
But > EF is rational, and, if an area be contained by a rational straight line and the second binomial, the side of the square equal to it is a first bimedial; [elem.10.55] therefore the 
 of the area > EI is a first bimedial, so that the 
 of > AD is also a first bimedial.
Next, let the square on > HK be greater than the square on > HE by the square on a straight line incommensurable with > HK.
Now the lesser straight line > EH is commensurable with the rational straight line > EF set out; therefore > EK is a fifth binomial. [elem.10.def.2.5]
But > EF is rational; and, if an area be contained by a rational straight line and the fifth binomial, the side of the square equal to the area is a side of a rational plus a medial area. [elem.10.58]
Therefore the 
 of the area > EI is a side of a rational plus a medial area, so that the 
 of the area > AD is also a side of a rational plus a medial area.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
