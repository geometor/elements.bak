Enunciation:
> If a straight line be cut in extreme and mean ratio, > and there be added to it a straight line equal to the greater segment, > the whole straight line has been cut in extreme and mean ratio, > and the original straight line is the greater segment.

Proof:
For let the straight line > AB be cut in extreme and mean ratio at the point > C, let > AC be the greater segment, and let > AD be equal to > AC.
I say that the straight line > DB has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at > A, and the original straight line > AB is the greater segment.
For let the square > AE be described on > AB, and let the figure be drawn.
Since > AB has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at > C, therefore the rectangle > AB, > BC is equal to the square on > AC. [elem.6.def.3 elem.6.17, VI. 17]
And > CE is the rectangle > AB, > BC, and > CH the square on > AC; therefore > CE is equal to > HC.
But > HE is equal to > CE, and > DH is equal to > HC; therefore > DH is also equal to > HE.
Therefore the whole > DK is equal to the whole > AE.
And > DK is the rectangle > BD, > DA, for > AD is equal to > DL; and > AE is the square on > AB; therefore the rectangle > BD, > DA is equal to the square on > AB.
Therefore, as > DB is to > BA, so is > BA to > AD. [elem.6.17]
And > DB is greater than > BA; therefore > BA is also greater than > AD. [elem.5.14]
Therefore > DB has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at > A, and > AB is the greater segment. Q. E. D.
