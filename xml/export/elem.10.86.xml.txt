> To find the second apotome.

Proof:
Let a rational straight line > A be set out, and > GC commensurable in length with > A; therefore > GC is rational.
Let two square numbers > DE, > EF be set out, and let their difference > DF not be square.
Now let it be contrived that, as > FD is to > DE, so is the square on > CG to the square on > GB. [elem.10.6.p.1]
Therefore the square on > CG is commensurable with the square on > GB. [elem.10.6]
But the square on > CG is rational; therefore the square on > GB is also rational; therefore > BG is rational.
And, since the square on > GC has not to the square on > GB the ratio which a square number has to a square number, > CG is incommensurable in length with > GB. [elem.10.9]
And both are rational; therefore > CG, > GB are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore > BC is an apotome. [elem.10.73]
I say next that it is also a second apotome.
For let the square on > H be that by which the square on > BG is greater than the square on > GC.
Since then, as the square on > BG is to the square on > GC, so is the number > ED to the number > DF, therefore, , as the square on > BG is to the square on > H, so is > DE to > EF. [elem.5.19.p.1]
And each of the numbers > DE, > EF is square; therefore the square on > BG has to the square on > H the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore > BG is commensurable in length with > H. [elem.10.9]
And the square on > BG is greater than the square on > GC by the square on > H; therefore the square on > BG is greater than the square on > GC
       by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with > BG.
And > CG, the annex, is commensurable with the rational straight line > A set out.
Therefore > BC is a second apotome. [elem.10.def.3.2]
Therefore the second apotome > BC has been found. Q. E. D.
