Enunciation:
`If on the diameter of a circle a point be taken which is not the centre of the circle`, `and from the point straight lines fall upon the circle`, `that will be greatest on which the centre is`, `the remainder of the same diameter will be least`, `and of the rest`
       `the nearer to the straight line through the centre is always greater than the more remote`, `and only two equal straight lines will fall from the point on the circle`, `one on each side of the least straight line`.

Proof:
Let `ABCD` be a circle, and let `AD` be a diameter of it; on `AD` let a point `F` be taken which is not the centre of the circle, let `E` be the centre of the circle, and from `F` let straight lines `FB`, `FC`, `FG` fall upon the circle `ABCD`; I say that `FA` is greatest, `FD` is least, and of the rest `FB` is greater than `FC`, and `FC` than `FG`.
For let `BE`, `CE`, `GE` be joined.
Then, since in any triangle two sides are greater than the remaining one, [elem.1.20] > `EB`, `EF` are greater than `BF`.
But `AE` is equal to `BE`; > therefore `AF` is greater than `BF`.
Again, since `BE` is equal to `CE`, and `FE` is common, the two sides `BE`, `EF` are equal to the two sides `CE`, `EF`.
But the angle `BEF` is also greater than the angle `CEF`; therefore the base `BF` is greater than the base `CF`. [elem.1.24]
For the same reason > `CF` is also greater than `FG`.
Again, since `GF`, `FE` are greater than `EG`, and `EG` is equal to `ED`, > `GF`, `FE` are greater than `ED`.
Let `EF` be subtracted from each; > therefore the remainder `GF` is greater than the remainder `FD`.
Therefore `FA` is greatest, `FD` is least, and `FB` is greater than `FC`, and `FC` than `FG`.
I say also that from the point `F` only two equal straight lines will fall on the circle `ABCD`, one on each side of the least `FD`.
For on the straight line `EF`, and at the point `E` on it, let the angle `FEH` be constructed equal to the angle `GEF` [elem.1.23], and let `FH` be joined.
Then, since `GE` is equal to `EH`, and `EF` is common, > the two sides `GE`, `EF` are equal to the two sides `HE`, `EF`; and the angle `GEF` is equal to the angle `HEF`;
       > therefore the base `FG` is equal to the base `FH`. [elem.1.4]
I say again that another straight line equal to `FG` will not fall on the circle from the point `F`.
For, if possible, let `FK` so fall.
Then, since `FK` is equal to `FG`, and `FH` to `FG`, > `FK` is also equal to `FH`, the nearer to the straight line through the centre being thus equal to the more remote: which is impossible.
Therefore another straight line equal to `GF` will not fall from the point `F` upon the circle; > therefore only one straight line will so fall.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
