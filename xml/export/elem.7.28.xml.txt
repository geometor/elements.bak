Proof:
For let two numbers ,  prime to one another be added; I say that the sum  is also prime to each of the numbers , .
For, if ,  are not prime to one another, some number will measure , .
Let a number measure them, and let it be .
Since then  measures , , therefore it will also measure the remainder .
But it also measures ; therefore  measures ,  which are prime to one another: which is impossible. [elem.7.def.12]
Therefore no number will measure the numbers , ; therefore ,  are prime to one another.
For the same reason ,  are also prime to one another.
Therefore  is prime to each of the numbers , .
Again, let ,  be prime to one another; I say that ,  are also prime to one another.
For, if ,  are not prime to one another, some number will measure , .
Let a number measure them, and let it be .
Now, since  measures each of the numbers , , it will also measure the whole .
But it also measures ; therefore  measures ,  which are prime to one another: which is impossible. [elem.7.def.12]
Therefore no number will measure the numbers , .
Therefore ,  are prime to one another. Q. E. D.
