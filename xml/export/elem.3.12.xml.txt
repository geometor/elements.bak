Enunciation:
`If two circles touch one another externally`, `the straight line joining their centres will pass through the point of contact`.

Proof:
For let the two circles `ABC`, `ADE` touch one another `A`, and let the centre `F` of `ABC`, and the centre `G` of `ADE`, be taken; `F` to `G` will pass through the point of contact at `A`.
For suppose it does not, `FCDG`, and let `AF`, `AG` be joined.
Then, since the point `F` is the centre of the circle `ABC`,
Again, since the point `G` is the centre of the circle `ADE`,
But `FA` was also proved equal to `FC`;  but it is also less [elem.1.20]: which is impossible.
Therefore the straight line joined from `F` to `G` will not fail to pass through the point of contact at `A`;
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.]
