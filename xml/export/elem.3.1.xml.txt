Enunciation:
`To find the centre of a given circle`.

Proof:
Let `ABC` be the given circle; thus it is required to find the centre of the circle `ABC`.
Let a straight line `AB` be drawn `D`; from `D` let `DC` be drawn at right angles to `AB` and let it be drawn through to `E`; let `CE` be bisected at `F`; `F` is the centre of the circle `ABC`.
For suppose it is not, but, if possible, let `G` be the centre, and let `GA`, `GD`, `GB` be joined.
Then, since `AD` is equal to `DB`, and `DG` is common,  and the base `GA` is equal to the base `GB`, for they are
But, when a straight line set up on a straight line makes the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right; [elem.1.def.10]
But the angle `FDB` is also right; therefore the angle `FDB` is equal to the angle `GDB`, the greater to the less: which is impossible.
Similarly we can prove that neither is any other point except `F`.
