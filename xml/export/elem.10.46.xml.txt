For, if possible, let it be divided at > D also, so that > AD, > DB are also incommensurable in square and make the sum of the squares on > AD, > DB medial, but twice the rectangle > AD, > DB rational.
Since then that by which twice the rectangle > AC, > CB differs from twice the rectangle > AD, > DB is also that by which the squares on > AD, > DB differ from the squares on > AC, > CB, while twice the rectangle > AC, > CB exceeds twice the rectangle > AD, > DB by a rational area, therefore the squares on > AD, > DB also exceed the squares on > AC, > CB by a rational area, though they are medial: which is impossible. [elem.10.26

Therefore the side of a rational plus a medial area is not divided at different points; therefore it is divided at one point only. Q. E. D.
