Enunciation:
> If as many even numbers as we please be added together, the whole is even.

Proof:
For let as many even numbers as we please, > AB, > BC, > CD, > DE, be added together; I say that the whole > AE is even.
For, since each of the numbers > AB, > BC, > CD, > DE is even, it has a half part; [elem.7.def.6] so that the whole > AE also has a half part.
But an even number is that which is divisible into two equal parts; [> id.] therefore > AE is even. Q. E. D.
