Enunciation:
> If two numbers be prime to two numbers, both to each, their products also will be prime to one another.

Proof:
For let the two numbers > A, > B be prime to the two numbers > C, > D; both to each, and let > A by multiplying > B make > E, and let > C by multiplying > D make > F; I say that > E, > F are prime to one another.
For, since each of the numbers > A, > B is prime to > C, therefore the product of > A, > B will also be prime to > C. [elem.7.24]
But the product of > A, > B is > E; therefore > E, > C are prime to one another.
For the same reason > E, > D are also prime to one another.
Therefore each of the numbers > C, > D is prime to > E.
Therefore the product of > C, > D will also be prime to > E. [elem.7.24]
But the product of > C, > D is > F.
Therefore > E, > F are prime to one another. Q. E. D.
