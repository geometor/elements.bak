Enunciation:
`If a magnitude be the same multiple of a magnitude that a part subtracted is of a part subtracted`, `the remainder will also be the same multiple of the remainder that the whole is of the whole`.

Proof:
For let the magnitude `AB` be the same multiple of the magnitude `CD` that the part `AE` subtracted is of the part `CF` subtracted; I say that the remainder `EB` is also the same multiple of the remainder `FD` that the whole `AB` is of the whole `CD`.
For, whatever multiple `AE` is of `CF`, let `EB` be made that multiple of `CG`.
Then, since `AE` is the same multiple of `CF` that `EB` is of `GC`, therefore `AE` is the same multiple of `CF` that `AB` is of `GF`. [elem.5.1]
But, by the assumption, `AE` is the same multiple of `CF` that `AB` is of `CD`.
Therefore `AB` is the same multiple of each of the magnitudes `GF`, `CD`;
Let `CF` be subtracted from each; therefore the remainder `GC` is equal to the remainder `FD`.
And, since `AE` is the same multiple of `CF` that `EB` is of `GC`, and `GC` is equal to `DF`, `AE` is the same multiple of `CF` that `EB` is of `FD`.
But, by hypothesis,
`AE` is the same multiple of `CF` that `AB` is of `CD`; therefore `EB` is the same multiple of `FD` that `AB` is of `CD`.
That is, the remainder `EB` will be the same multiple of `FD` that the whole `AB` is of the whole `CD`.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
