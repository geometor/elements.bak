Enunciation:
On a given straight line to describe a square.

Proof:
Let `AB` be the given straight line; thus it is required to describe a square on the straight line `AB`.
Let `AC` be drawn at right angles to the straight line `AB` from the point `A` on it [elem.1.11], and let `AD` be made equal to `AB`; through the point `D` let `DE` be drawn `AB`, and through the point `B` let `BE` be drawn parallel to `AD`. [elem.1.31]
Therefore `ADEB` is a parallelogram;
But `AB` is equal to `AD`;  therefore the parallelogram `ADEB` is equilateral.
I say next that it is also right-angled.
For, since the straight line `AD` falls upon the parallels `AB`, `DE`,
But the angle `BAD` is right;
And in parallelogrammic areas the opposite sides and elem.1.34]
And it was also proved equilateral.
Therefore it is a square; and it is described on the straight line `AB`.
