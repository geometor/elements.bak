Enunciation:
> A straight line commensurable with that which produces with a rational area a medial whole is a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole.

Proof:
Let > AB be a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole, and > CD commensurable with > AB; I say that > CD is also a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole.
For let > BE be the annex to > AB; therefore > AE, > EB are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on > AE, > EB medial, but the rectangle contained by them rational. [elem.10.77]
Let the same construction be made.
Then we can prove, in manner similar to the foregoing, that > CF, > FD are in the same ratio as > AE, > EB, the sum of the squares on > AE, > EB is commensurable with the sum of the squares on > CF, > FD, and the rectangle > AE, > EB with the rectangle > CF, > FD; so that > CF, > FD are also straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on > CF, > FD medial, but the rectangle contained by them rational.
Therefore > CD is a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole. [elem.10.77] Q. E. D.
