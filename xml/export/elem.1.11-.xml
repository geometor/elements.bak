       <p>To draw a straight line at right angles to a given straight line from a given point on it.</p>

      <div4 type="Proof" org="uniform" sample="complete">
       <p>Let <emph>AB</emph> be the given straight line, and <emph>C</emph> the given point on it. <lb n="5"/></p>
       <p>Thus it is required to draw from the point <emph>C</emph> a straight line at right angles to the straight line <emph>AB</emph>.</p>
       <p>Let a point <emph>D</emph> be taken at random on <emph>AC</emph>; <lb n="10"/>let <emph>CE</emph> be made equal to <emph>CD</emph>; [<ref target="elem.1.3" targOrder="U">I. 3</ref>] on <emph>DE</emph> let the equilateral triangle <emph>FDE</emph> be constructed, [<ref target="elem.1.1" targOrder="U">I. 1</ref>] and let <emph>FC</emph> be joined; <figure/></p>
       <p>I say that the straight line <emph>FC</emph> has been drawn at right <lb n="15"/>angles to the given straight line <emph>AB</emph> from <emph>C</emph> the given point on it.</p>
       <p>For, since <emph>DC</emph> is equal to <emph>CE</emph>, and <emph>CF</emph> is common, <hi rend="center">the two sides <emph>DC</emph>, <emph>CF</emph> are equal to the two sides <emph>EC</emph>, <lb n="20"/><emph>CF</emph> respectively;</hi> and the base <emph>DF</emph> is equal to the base <emph>FE</emph>; <hi rend="center">therefore the angle <emph>DCF</emph> is equal to the angle <emph>ECF</emph>; [<ref target="elem.1.8" targOrder="U">I. 8</ref>]</hi> and they are adjacent angles.</p>
       <p>But, when a straight line set up on a straight line makes <lb n="25"/>the adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right; [<ref target="elem.1.def.10" targOrder="U">Def. 10</ref>] <hi rend="center">therefore each of the angles <emph>DCF</emph>, <emph>FCE</emph> is right.</hi></p>
       <p>Therefore the straight line <emph>CF</emph> has been drawn at right angles to the given straight line <emph>AB</emph> from the given point <lb n="30"/><emph>C</emph> on it.</p>

       <p>The verb is <foreign lang="greek">κείσθω</foreign> which, as well as the other parts of <foreign lang="greek">κεῖμαι</foreign>, is constantly used for the passive of <foreign lang="greek">τίθημι</foreign> <quote>to <emph>place</emph></quote>
