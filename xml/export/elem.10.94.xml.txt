> If an area be contained by a rational straight line and a fourth apotome, the 
 of the area is minor.

Proof:
For let the area > AB be contained by the rational straight line > AC and the fourth apotome > AD; I say that the 
 of the area > AB is minor.
For let > DG be the annex to > AD; therefore > AG, > GD are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, > AG is commensurable in length with the rational straight line > AC set out, and the square on the whole > AG is greater than the square on the annex > DG by the square on a straight line incommensurable in length with > AG, [elem.10.def.3.4]
Since then the square on > AG is greater than the square on > GD by the square on a straight line incommensurable in length with > AG, therefore, if there be applied to > AG a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on > DG and deficient by a square figure, it will divide it into incommensurable parts. [elem.10.18]
Let then > DG be bisected at > E, let there be applied to > AG a parallelogram equal to the square on > EG and deficient by a square figure, and let it be the rectangle > AF, > FG; therefore > AF is incommensurable in length with > FG.
Let > EH, > FI, > GK be drawn through > E, > F, > G parallel to > AC, > BD.
Since then > AG is rational and commensurable in length with > AC, therefore the whole > AK is rational. [elem.10.19]
Again, since > DG is incommensurable in length with > AC, and both are rational, therefore > DK is medial. [elem.10.21]
Again, since > AF is incommensurable in length with > FG, therefore > AI is also incommensurable with > FK. [elem.6.1, elem.10.11]
Now let the square > LM be constructed equal to > AI, and let there be subtracted > NO equal to > FK and about the same angle, the angle > LPM.
Therefore the squares > LM, > NO are about the same diameter. [elem.6.26]
Let > PR be their diameter, and let the figure be drawn.
Since then the rectangle > AF, > FG is equal to the square on > EG, therefore, proportionally, as > AF is to > EG, so is > EG to > FG. [elem.6.17]
But, as > AF is to > EG, so is > AI to > EK, and, as > EG is to > FG, so is > EK to > FK; [elem.6.1] therefore > EK is a mean proportional between > AI, > FK. [elem.5.11]
But > MN is also a mean proportional between the squares > LM, > NO, and > AI is equal to > LM, and > FK to > NO; therefore > EK is also equal to > MN.
But > DH is equal to > EK, and > LO is equal to > MN; therefore the whole > DK is equal to the gnomon > UVW and > NO.
Since, then, the whole > AK is equal to the squares > LM, > NO, and, in these, > DK is equal to the gnomon > UVW and the square > NO, therefore the remainder > AB is equal to > ST, that is, to the square on > LN; therefore > LN is the 
 of the area > AB.
I say that > LN is the irrational straight line called minor.
For, since > AK is rational and is equal to the squares on > LP, > PN, therefore the sum of the squares on > LP, > PN is rational.
Again, since > DK is medial, and > DK is equal to twice the rectangle > LP, > PN, therefore twice the rectangle > LP, > PN is medial.
And, since > AI was proved incommensurable with > FK, therefore the square on > LP is also incommensurable with the square on > PN.
Therefore > LP, > PN are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them rational, but twice the rectangle contained by them medial.
Therefore > LN is the irrational straight line called minor; [elem.10.76] and it is the 
 of the area > AB.
Therefore the 
 of the area > AB is minor. Q. E. D.
