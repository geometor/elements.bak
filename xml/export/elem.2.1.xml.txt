Enunciation:
`If there be two straight lines`, `and one of them be cut into any number of segments whatever`, `the rectangle contained by the two straight lines is equal to the rectangles contained by the uncut straight line and each of the segments`.

Proof:
Let `A`, `BC` be two straight lines, and let `BC` be cut at random at the points `D`, `E`; I say that the rectangle contained by `A`, `BC` is equal to the rectangle contained by `A`, `BD`, that contained by `A`, `DE` and that contained by `A`, `EC`.
For let `BF` be drawn from `B` at right angles to `BC`; [elem.1.11] let `BG` be made equal to `A`, [elem.1.3] through `G` let `GH` be drawn parallel to `BC`, [elem.1.31] and through `D`, `E`, `C` let `DK`, `EL`, `CH` be drawn parallel to `BG`.
Then `BH` is equal to `BK`, `DL`, `EH`.
Now `BH` is the rectangle `A`, `BC`, for it is contained by `GB`, `BC`, and `BG` is equal to `A`;
`BK` is the rectangle `A`, `BD`, for it is contained by `GB`, `BD`, and `BG` is equal to `A`; > and `DL` is the rectangle `A`, `DE`, for `DK`, that is `BG` [elem.1.34], is equal to `A`.
Similarly also `EH` is the rectangle `A`, `EC`.
Therefore the rectangle `A`, `BC` is equal to the rectangle `A`, `BD`, the rectangle `A`, `DE` and the rectangle `A`, `EC`.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
