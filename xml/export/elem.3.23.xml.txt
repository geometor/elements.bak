`On the same straight line there cannot be constructed two similar and unequal segments of circles on the same side`.

Proof:
For, if possible, on the same straight line `AB` let two similar and unequal segments of circles `ACB`, `ADB` be constructed on the same side; `ACD` be drawn through, and let `CB`, `DB` be joined.
Then, since the segment `ACB` is similar to the segment `ADB`, elem.3.def.11]
