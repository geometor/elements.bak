Proof:
Let , ,  be the three given numbers; thus it is required to find the least number which they measure.
Let , the least number measured by the two numbers , , be taken. [elem.7.34]
Then  either measures, or does not measure, .
First, let it measure it.
But ,  also measure ; therefore , ,  measure .
I say next that it is also the least that they measure.
For, if not, , ,  will measure some number which is less than .
Let them measure .
Since , ,  measure , therefore also ,  measure .
Therefore the least number measured by ,  will also measure . [elem.7.35]
But  is the least number measured by , ; therefore  will measure , the greater the less: which is impossible.
Therefore , ,  will not measure any number which is less than ;
Again, let  not measure , and let , the least number measured by , , be taken. [elem.7.34]
Since ,  measure , and  measures , therefore also ,  measure .
But  also measures ; therefore also , ,  measure .
I say next that it is also the least that they measure.
For, if not, , ,  will measure some number which is less than .
Let them measure .
Since , ,  measure , therefore also ,  measure ; therefore the least number measured by ,  will also measure . [elem.7.35]
But  is the least number measured by , ; therefore  measures .
But  also measures ; therefore ,  measure , so that the least number measured by ,  will also measure .
But  is the least number measured by , ; therefore  measures , the greater the less: which is impossible.
Therefore , ,  will not measure any number which is less than .
Therefore  is the least that is measured by , , . Q. E. D.
