Enunciation:
`If a straight line be cut at random`, `the rectangle contained by the whole and one of the segments is equal to the rectangle contained by the segments and the square on the aforesaid segment`.

Proof:
For let the straight line `AB` be cut at random at `C`; I say that the rectangle contained by `AB`, `BC` is equal to the rectangle contained by `AC`, `CB` together with the square on `BC`.
For let the square `CDEB` be described on `CB`; [elem.1.46] let `ED` be drawn through to `F`, and through `A` let `AF` be drawn parallel to either `CD` or `BE`. [elem.1.31]
Then `AE` is equal to `AD`, `CE`.
Now `AE` is the rectangle contained by `AB`, `BC`, for it is contained by `AB`, `BE`, and `BE` is equal to `BC`;
`AD` is the rectangle `AC`, `CB`, for `DC` is equal to `CB`; . Therefore the rectangle contained by `AB`, `BC` is equal to the rectangle contained by `AC`, `CB` together with the square on `BC`.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
