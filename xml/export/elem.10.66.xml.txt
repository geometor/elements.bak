Proof:
Let  be binomial, and let  be commensurable in length with ;  I say that  is binomial and the same in order with .
For, since  is binomial, let it be divided into its terms at , and let  be the greater term; therefore ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only. [elem.10.36]
Let it be contrived that, as  is to , so is  to ; [elem.6.12] therefore also the remainder  is to the remainder  as  is to . [elem.5.19]
But  is commensurable in length with ; therefore  is also commensurable with , and  with . [elem.10.11]
And ,  are rational; therefore ,  are also rational.
And, as  is to , so is  to . [elem.5.11]
Therefore, alternately, as  is to , so is  to . [elem.5.16]
But ,  are commensurable in square only; therefore ,  are also commensurable in square only. [elem.10.11]
And they are rational; therefore  is binomial. [elem.10.36]
I say next that it is the same in order with .
For the square on  is greater than the square on  either by the square on a straight line commensurable with  or by the square on a straight line incommensurable with it.
If then the square on  is greater than the square on  by the square on a straight line commensurable with , the square on  will also be greater than the square on  by the square on a straight line commensurable with . [elem.10.14]
And, if  is commensurable with the rational straight line set out,  will also be commensurable with it, [elem.10.12] and for this reason each of the straight lines ,  is a first binomial, that is, the same in order. [elem.10.def.2.1]
But, if  is commensurable with the rational straight line set out,  is also commensurable with it, [elem.10.12] and for this reason again  will be the same in order with , for each of them will be a second binomial. [elem.10.def.2.2]
But, if neither of the straight lines ,  is commensurable with the rational straight line set out, neither of the straight lines ,  will be commensurable with it, [elem.10.13] and each of the straight lines ,  is a third binomial. [elem.10.def.2.3]
But, if the square on  is greater than the square on  by the square on a straight line incommensurable with , the square on  is also greater than the square on  by the square on a straight line incommensurable with . [elem.10.14]
And, if  is commensurable with the rational straight line set out,  is also commensurable with it, and each of the straight lines ,  is a fourth binomial. [elem.10.def.2.4]
But, if  is so commensurable, so is  also, and each of the straight lines ,  will be a fifth binomial. [elem.10.def.2.5]
But, if neither of the straight lines ,  is so commensurable, neither of the straight lines ,  is commensurable with the rational straight line set out, and each of the straight lines ,  will be a sixth binomial. [elem.10.def.2.6]
Hence a straight line commensurable in length with a binomial straight line is binomial and the same in order. Q. E. D.
