> A straight line commensurable in length with a binomial straight line is itself also binomial and the same in order.

Proof:
Let > AB be binomial, and let > CD be commensurable in length with > AB;  I say that > CD is binomial and the same in order with > AB.
For, since > AB is binomial, let it be divided into its terms at > E, and let > AE be the greater term; therefore > AE, > EB are rational straight lines commensurable in square only. [elem.10.36]
Let it be contrived that, as > AB is to > CD, so is > AE to > CF; [elem.6.12] therefore also the remainder > EB is to the remainder > FD as > AB is to > CD. [elem.5.19]
But > AB is commensurable in length with > CD; therefore > AE is also commensurable with > CF, and > EB with > FD. [elem.10.11]
And > AE, > EB are rational; therefore > CF, > FD are also rational.
And, as > AE is to > CF, so is > EB to > FD. [elem.5.11]
Therefore, alternately, as > AE is to > EB, so is > CF to > FD. [elem.5.16]
But > AE, > EB are commensurable in square only; therefore > CF, > FD are also commensurable in square only. [elem.10.11]
And they are rational; therefore > CD is binomial. [elem.10.36]
I say next that it is the same in order with > AB.
For the square on > AE is greater than the square on > EB either by the square on a straight line commensurable with > AE or by the square on a straight line incommensurable with it.
If then the square on > AE is greater than the square on > EB by the square on a straight line commensurable with > AE, the square on > CF will also be greater than the square on > FD by the square on a straight line commensurable with > CF. [elem.10.14]
And, if > AE is commensurable with the rational straight line set out, > CF will also be commensurable with it, [elem.10.12] and for this reason each of the straight lines > AB, > CD is a first binomial, that is, the same in order. [elem.10.def.2.1]
But, if > EB is commensurable with the rational straight line set out, > FD is also commensurable with it, [elem.10.12] and for this reason again > CD will be the same in order with > AB, for each of them will be a second binomial. [elem.10.def.2.2]
But, if neither of the straight lines > AE, > EB is commensurable with the rational straight line set out, neither of the straight lines > CF, > FD will be commensurable with it, [elem.10.13] and each of the straight lines > AB, > CD is a third binomial. [elem.10.def.2.3]
But, if the square on > AE is greater than the square on > EB by the square on a straight line incommensurable with > AE, the square on > CF is also greater than the square on > FD by the square on a straight line incommensurable with > CF. [elem.10.14]
And, if > AE is commensurable with the rational straight line set out, > CF is also commensurable with it, and each of the straight lines > AB, > CD is a fourth binomial. [elem.10.def.2.4]
But, if > EB is so commensurable, so is > FD also, and each of the straight lines > AB, > CD will be a fifth binomial. [elem.10.def.2.5]
But, if neither of the straight lines > AE, > EB is so commensurable, neither of the straight lines > CF, > FD is commensurable with the rational straight line set out, and each of the straight lines > AB, > CD will be a sixth binomial. [elem.10.def.2.6]
Hence a straight line commensurable in length with a binomial straight line is binomial and the same in order. Q. E. D.
