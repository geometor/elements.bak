Proof:
For let the two magnitudes ,  have to one another the ratio which the number  has to the number ; ,  are commensurable.
For let  be divided into as many equal parts as there are units in , and let  be equal to one of them; and let  be made up of as many magnitudes equal to  as .
Since then there are in  as many magnitudes equal to  as there are units in , whatever part the unit is of , the same part is  of  also; therefore, as  is to , so is the unit to . [elem.7.def.20]
But the unit measures the number ; therefore  also measures .
And since, as  is to , so is the unit to , therefore, inversely, as  is to , so is the number  to the unit. [cf. elem.5.7.p.1]
Again, since there are in  as many magnitudes equal to  as there are units in , therefore, as  is to , so is the unit to . [elem.7.def.20]
But it was also proved that, 
       , as  is to , so is  to . [elem.5.22]
But, as  is to , so is  to ; therefore also, as  is to , so is it to  also. [elem.5.11]
Therefore  has the same ratio to each of the magnitudes , ;  is equal to . A[elem.5.9]
But  measures ; therefore it measures  also.
Further it measures  also; therefore  measures , .
Therefore  is commensurable with .
Therefore etc.
