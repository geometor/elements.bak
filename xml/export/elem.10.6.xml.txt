> If two magnitudes have to one another the ratio which a number has to a number, > the magnitudes will be commensurable.

Proof:
For let the two magnitudes > A, > B have to one another the ratio which the number > D has to the number > E; I say that the magnitudes > A, > B are commensurable.
For let > A be divided into as many equal parts as there are units in > D, and let > C be equal to one of them; and let > F be made up of as many magnitudes equal to > C as there are units in > E.
Since then there are in > A as many magnitudes equal to > C as there are units in > D, whatever part the unit is of > D, the same part is > C of > A also; therefore, as > C is to > A, so is the unit to > D. [elem.7.def.20]
But the unit measures the number > D; therefore > C also measures > A.
And since, as > C is to > A, so is the unit to > D, therefore, inversely, as > A is to > C, so is the number > D to the unit. [cf. elem.5.7.p.1]
Again, since there are in > F as many magnitudes equal to > C as there are units in > E, therefore, as > C is to > F, so is the unit to > E. [elem.7.def.20]
But it was also proved that, > as > A is to > C, so is > D to the unit;
       therefore, , as > A is to > F, so is > D to > E. [elem.5.22]
But, as > D is to > E, so is > A to > B; therefore also, as > A is to > B, so is it to > F also. [elem.5.11]
Therefore > A has the same ratio to each of the magnitudes > B, > F; therefore > B is equal to > F. A[elem.5.9]
But > C measures > F; therefore it measures > B also.
Further it measures > A also; therefore > C measures > A, > B.
Therefore > A is commensurable with > B.
Therefore etc.
