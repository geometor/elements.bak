Enunciation:
> If an odd number by multiplying an odd number make some number, the product will be odd.

Proof:
For let the odd number > A by multiplying the odd number > B make > C; I say that > C is odd.
For, since > A by multiplying > B has made > C, therefore > C is made up of as many numbers equal to > B as there are units in > A. [elem.7.def.15]
And each of the numbers > A, > B is odd; therefore > C is made up of odd numbers the multitude of which is odd.
Thus > C is odd. [elem.9.23] Q. E. D.
