> The square on the side of a rational plus a medial area applied to a rational straight line produces as breadth the fifth binomial.

Proof:
Let > AB be the side of a rational plus a medial area, divided into its straight lines at > C, so that > AC is the greater; let a rational straight line > DE be set out, and let there be applied to > DE the parallelogram > DF equal to the square on > AB, producing > DG as its breadth; I say that > DG is a fifth binomial straight line.
Let the same construction as before be made.
Since then > AB is the side of a rational plus a medial area, divided at > C, therefore > AC, > CB are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them medial, but the rectangle contained by them rational. [elem.10.40]
Since then the sum of the squares on > AC, > CB is medial, therefore > DL is medial, so that > DM is rational and incommensurable in length with > DE. [elem.10.22]
Again, since twice the rectangle > AC, > CB, that is > MF, is rational, therefore > MG is rational and commensurable with > DE. [elem.10.20]
Therefore > DM is incommensurable with > MG; [elem.10.13] therefore > DM, > MG are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore > DG is binomial. [elem.10.36]
I say next that it is also a fifth binomial straight line.
For it can be proved similarly that the rectangle > DK, > KM is equal to the square on > MN, and that > DK is incommensurable in length with > KM; therefore the square on > DM is greater than the square on > MG by the square on a straight line incommensurable with > DM. [elem.10.18]
And > DM, > MG are commensurable in square only, and the less, > MG, is commensurable in length with > DE.
Therefore > DG is a fifth binomial. Q. E. D.
