Enunciation:
`Parts have the same ratio as the same multiples of them taken in corresponding order`.

Proof:
For let `AB` be the same multiple of `C` that `DE` is of `F`; I say that, as `C` is to `F`, so is `AB` to `DE`.
For, since `AB` is the same multiple of `C` that `DE` is of `F`, as many magnitudes as there are in `AB` equal to `C`, so many are there also in `DE` equal to `F`.
Let `AB` be divided into the magnitudes `AG`, `GH`, `HB` equal to `C`, and `DE` into the magnitudes `DK`, `KL`, `LE` equal to `F`; then the multitude of the magnitudes `AG`, `GH`, `HB` will be equal to the multitude of the magnitudes `DK`, `KL`, `LE`.
And, since `AG`. `GH`, `HB` are equal to one another, and `DK`, `KL`, `LE` are also equal to one another, therefore, as `AG` is to `DK`, so is `GH` to `KL`, and `HB` to `LE`. [elem.5.7]
Therefore, as one of the antecedents is to one of the consequents, so will all the antecedents be to all the consequents; [elem.5.12] > therefore, as `AG` is to `DK`, so is `AB` to `DE`.
But `AG` is equal to `C` and `DK` to `F`; > therefore, as `C` is to `F`, so is `AB` to `DE`.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
