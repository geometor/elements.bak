Proof:
Let  be an apotome; I say that  is not the same with the binomial straight line.
For, if possible, let it be so; let a rational straight line  be set out, and to  let there be applied the rectangle  equal to the square on  and producing  as breadth.
Then, since  is an apotome,  is a first apotome. [elem.10.97]
Let  be the annex to it; therefore ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, the square on  is greater than the square on  by the square on a straight line commensurable with , and  is commensurable in length with the rational straight line  set out. [elem.10.def.3.1]
Again, since  is binomial, therefore  is a first binomial straight line. [elem.10.60]
Let it be divided into its terms at , and let  be the greater term; therefore ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, the square on  is greater than the square on  by the square on a straight line commensurable with , and the greater term  is commensurable in length with the rational straight line  set out. [elem.10.def.2.1]
Therefore  is also commensurable in length with ; [elem.10.12] therefore the remainder  is also commensurable in length with . [elem.10.15]
But  is incommensurable in length with ; therefore  is also incommensurable in length with . [elem.10.13]
Therefore ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore  is an apotome. [elem.10.73]
But it is also rational: which is impossible.
Therefore the apotome is not the same with the binomial straight line. Q. E. D.
