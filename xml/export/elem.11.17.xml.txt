Enunciation:
> If two straight lines be cut by parallel planes, > they will be cut in the same ratios.

Proof:
For let the two straight lines > AB, > CD be cut by the parallel planes > GH, > KL, > MN at the points > A, > E, > B and > C, > F, > D; I say that, as the straight line > AE is to > EB, so is > CF to > FD.
For let > AC, > BD, > AD be joined, let > AD meet the plane > KL at the point > O, and let > EO, > OF be joined.
Now, since the two parallel planes > KL, > MN are cut by the plane > EBDO, their common sections > EO, > BD are parallel. [elem.11.16]
For the same reason, since the two parallel planes > GH, > KL are cut by the plane > AOFC, their common sections > AC, > OF are parallel. [> id.]
And, since the straight line > EO has been drawn parallel to > BD, one of the sides of the triangle > ABD, therefore, proportionally, as > AE is to > EB, so is > AO to > OD. [elem.6.2]
Again, since the straight line > OF has been drawn parallel to > AC, one of the sides of the triangle > ADC, proportionally, as > AO is to > OD, so is > CF to > FD. [> id.]
But it was also proved that, as > AO is to > OD, so is > AE to > EB; therefore also, as > AE is to > EB, so is > CF to > FD. [elem.5.11]
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
