Enunciation:
`Equiangular parallelograms have to one another the ratio compounded of the ratios of their sides`.

Proof:
Let `AC`, `CF` be equiangular parallelograms having the angle `BCD` equal to the angle `ECG`; I say that the parallelogram `AC` has to the parallelogram `CF` the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides.
For let them be placed so that `BC` is in a straight line with `CG`;
Let the parallelogram `DG` be completed; let a straight line `K` be set out, and let it be contrived that,  and, as `DC` is to `CE`, so is `L` to `M`. [elem.6.12]
Then the ratios of `K` to `L` and of `L` to `M` are the same as the ratios of the sides, namely of `BC` to `CG` and of `DC` to `CE`.
But the ratio of `K` to `M` is compounded of the ratio of `K` to `L` and of that of `L` to `M`; so that `K` has also to `M` the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides.
Now since, as `BC` is to `CG`, so is the parallelogram `AC` to the parallelogram `CH`, [elem.6.1] while, as `BC` is to `CG`, so is `K` to `L`, therefore also, as `K` is to `L`, so is `AC` to `CH`. [elem.5.11]
Again, since, as `DC` is to `CE`, so is the parallelogram `CH` to `CF`, [elem.6.1] while, as `DC` is to `CE`, so is `L` to `M`, therefore also, as `L` is to `M`, so is the parallelogram `CH` to the parallelogram `CF`. [elem.5.11]
Since then it was proved that, as `K` is to `L`, so is the parallelogram `AC` to the parallelogram `CH`, and, as `L` is to `M`, so is the parallelogram `CH` to the parallelogram `CF`, therefore, , as `K` is to `M`, so is `AC` to the parallelogram
       `CF`.
But `K` has to `M` the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides;
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
