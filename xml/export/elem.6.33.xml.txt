Enunciation:
`In equal circles angles have the same ratio as the circumferences on which they stand`, `whether they stand at the centres or at the circumferences`.

Proof:
Let `ABC`, `DEF` be equal circles, and let the angles `BGC`, `EHF` be angles at their centres `G`, `H`, and the angles `BAC`, `EDF` angles at the circumferences; I say that, as the circumference `BC` is to the circumference `EF`, so is the angle `BGC` to the angle `EHF`, and the angle `BAC` to the angle `EDF`.
For let any number of consecutive circumferences `CK`, `KL` be made equal to the circumference `BC`, and any number of consecutive circumferences `FM`, `MN` equal to the circumference `EF`; and let `GK`, `GL`, `HM`, `HN` be joined.
Then, since the circumferences `BC`, `CK`, `KL` are equal to one another, the angles `BGC`, `CGK`, `KGL` are also equal to one another; [elem.3.27] `BL` is of `BC`, that multiple also is the angle `BGL` of the angle `BGC`.
For the same reason also, whatever multiple the circumference `NE` is of `EF`, that multiple also is the angle `NHE` of the angle `EHF`.
If then the circumference `BL` is equal to the circumference `EN`, the angle `BGL` is also equal to the angle `EHN`; [elem.3.27] if the circumference `BL` is greater than the circumference `EN`, the angle `BGL` is also greater than the angle `EHN`; and, if less, less.
There being then four magnitudes, two circumferences `BC`, `EF`, and two angles `BGC`, `EHF`, there have been taken, of the circumference `BC` and the angle `BGC` equimultiples, namely the circumference `BL` and the angle `BGL`, and of the circumference `EF` and the angle `EHF` equimultiples, namely the circumference `EN` and the angle `EHN`.
And it has been proved that, if the circumference `BL` is in excess of the circumference `EN`, the angle `BGL` is also in excess of the angle `EHN`; if equal, equal; and if less, less.
Therefore, as the circumference `BC` is to `EF`, so is the angle `BGC` to the angle `EHF`. [elem.5.def.5]
But, as the angle `BGC` is to the angle `EHF`, so is the angle `BAC` to the angle `EDF`; for they are doubles respectively.
Therefore also, as the circumference `BC` is to the circumference `EF`, so is the angle `BGC` to the angle `EHF`, and the angle `BAC` to the angle `EDF`.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
