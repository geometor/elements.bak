Enunciation:
`If two circles touch one another`, `they will not have the same centre`.

Proof:
For let the two circles `ABC`, `CDE` touch one another at the point `C`; I say that they will not have the same centre.
For, if possible, let it be `F`; let `FC` be joined, and let `FEB` be drawn through at random.
Then, since the point `F` is the centre of the circle `ABC`,
Again, since the point `F` is the centre of the circle `CDE`,
But `FC` was proved equal to `FB`;
Therefore `F` is not the centre of the circles `ABC`, `CDE`.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
