> If from a rational straight line there be subtracted a rational straight line commensurable with the whole in square only, the remainder is irrational; and let it be called
       > an apotome.

Proof:
For from the rational straight line > AB let the rational straight line > BC, commensurable with the whole in square only, be subtracted;  I say that the remainder > AC is the irrational straight line called > apotome.
For, since > AB is incommensurable in length with > BC, and, as > AB is to > BC, so is the square on > AB to the rectangle > AB, > BC, therefore the square on > AB is incommensurable with the rectangle > AB, > BC. [elem.10.11]
But the squares on > AB, > BC are commensurable with the square on > AB, [elem.10.15] and twice the rectangle > AB, > BC is commensurable with the rectangle > AB, > BC. [elem.10.6]
And, inasmuch as the squares on > AB, > BC are equal to twice the rectangle > AB, > BC together with the square on > CA, [elem.2.7] therefore the squares on > AB, > BC are also incommensurable with the remainder, the square on > AC. [elem.10.13 elem.10.16]
But the squares on > AB, > BC are rational; therefore > AC is irrational. [elem.10.def.4]
And let it be called an > apotome. Q. E. D.
