Proof:
For from the rational straight line  let the rational straight line , commensurable with the whole in square only, be subtracted;  is the irrational straight line called .
For, since  is incommensurable in length with , and, as  is to , so is the square on  to the rectangle , , therefore the square on  is incommensurable with the rectangle , . [elem.10.11]
But the squares on ,  are commensurable with the square on , [elem.10.15] and twice the rectangle ,  is commensurable with the rectangle , . [elem.10.6]
And, inasmuch as the squares on ,  are equal to twice the rectangle ,  together with the square on , [elem.2.7] therefore the squares on ,  are also incommensurable with the remainder, the square on . [elem.10.13 elem.10.16]
But the squares on ,  are rational; therefore  is irrational. [elem.10.def.4]
And let it be called an . Q. E. D.
