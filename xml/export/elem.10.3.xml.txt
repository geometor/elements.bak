Enunciation:
> Given two commensurable magnitudes, to find their greatest common measure.

Proof:
Let the two given commensurable magnitudes be > AB, > CD of which > AB is the less; thus it is required to find the greatest common measure of > AB, > CD.
Now the magnitude > AB either measures > CD or it does not.
If then it measures it—and it measures itself also—> AB is a common measure of > AB, > CD.
And it is manifest that it is also the greatest; for a greater magnitude than the magnitude > AB will not measure > AB.
Next, let > AB not measure > CD.
Then, if the less be continually subtracted in turn from the greater, that which is left over will sometime measure the one before it, because > AB, > CD are not incommensurable; [cf. elem.10.2] let > AB, measuring > ED, leave > EC less than itself, let > EC, measuring > FB, leave > AF less than itself, and let > AF measure > CE.
Since, then, > AF measures > CE, while > CE measures > FB, therefore > AF will also measure > FB.
But it measures itself also; therefore > AF will also measure the whole > AB.
But > AB measures > DE; therefore > AF will also measure > ED.
But it measures > CE also; therefore it also measures the whole > CD.
Therefore > AF is a common measure of > AB, > CD.
I say next that it is also the greatest.
For, if not, there will be some magnitude greater than > AF which will measure > AB, > CD.
Let it be > G.
Since then > G measures > AB, while > AB measures > ED, therefore > G will also measure > ED.
But it measures the whole > CD also; therefore > G will also measure the remainder > CE.
But > CE measures > FB; therefore > G will also measure > FB.
But it measures the whole > AB also, and it will therefore measure the remainder > AF, the greater the less: which is impossible.
Therefore no magnitude greater than > AF will measure > AB, > CD; therefore > AF is the greatest common measure of > AB, > CD.
Therefore the greatest common measure of the two given commensurable magnitudes > AB, > CD has been found. Q. E. D.
