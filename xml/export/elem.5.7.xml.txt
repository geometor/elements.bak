Enunciation:
`Equal magnitudes have to the same the same ratio`, `as also has the same to equal magnitudes`.

Proof:
Let `A`, `B` be equal magnitudes and `C` any other, chance, magnitude; I say that each of the magnitudes `A`, `B` has the same ratio to `C`, and `C` has the same ratio to each of the magnitudes `A`, `B`.
For let equimultiples `D`, `E` of `A`, `B` be taken, and of `C` another, chance, multiple `F`.
Then, since `D` is the same multiple of `A` that `E` is of `B`, while `A` is equal to `B`, > therefore `D` is equal to `E`.
But `F` is another, chance, magnitude.
If therefore `D` is in excess of `F`, `E` is also in excess of `F`, if equal to it, equal; and, if less, less.
And `D`, `E` are equimultiples of `A`, `B`, while `F` is another, chance, multiple of `C`; > therefore, as `A` is to `C`, so is `B` to `C`. [elem.5.def.5]
I say next that `C` also has the same ratio to each of the magnitudes `A`, `B`.
For, with the same construction, we can prove similarly that `D` is equal to `E`; and `F` is some other magnitude.
If therefore `F` is in excess of `D`, it is also in excess of `E`, if equal, equal; and, if less, less.
And `F` is a multiple of `C`, while `D`, `E` are other, chance, equimultiples of `A`, `B`; > therefore, as `C` is to `A`, so is `C` to `B`. [elem.5.def.5]
Therefore etc.
