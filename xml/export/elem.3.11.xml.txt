Enunciation:
`If two circles touch one another internally`, `and their centres be taken`, `the straight line joining their centres`, `if it be also produced`, `will fall on the point of contact of the circles`.

Proof:
For let the two circles `ABC`, `ADE` touch one another internally at the point `A`, and let the centre `F` of the circle `ABC`, and the centre `G` of `ADE`, be taken; I say that the straight line joined from `G` to `F` and produced will fall on `A`.
For suppose it does not, but, if possible, let it fall as `FGH`, and let `AF`, `AG` be joined.
Then, since `AG`, `GF` are greater than `FA`, that is, than `FH`,
let `FG` be subtracted from each; therefore the remainder `AG` is greater than the remainder `GH`.
But `AG` is equal to `GD`;
Therefore the straight line joined from `F` to `G` will not fall outside;
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
