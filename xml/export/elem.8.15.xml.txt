Enunciation:
> If a cube number measure a cube number, the side will also measure the side; and, if the side measure the side, the cube will also measure the cube.

Proof:
For let the cube number > A measure the cube > B, and let > C be the side of > A and > D of > B; I say that > C measures > D.
For let > C by multiplying itself make > E, and let > D by multiplying itself make > G; further, let > C by multiplying > D make > F, and let > C, > D by multiplying > F make > H, > K respectively.
Now it is manifest that > E, > F, > G and > A, > H, > K, > B are continuously proportional in the ratio of > C to > D. [elem.8.11 elem.8.12]
And, since > A, > H, > K, > B are continuously proportional, and > A measures > B, therefore it also measures > H. [elem.8.7]
And, as > A is to > H, so is > C to > D; therefore > C also measures > D. [elem.7.def.20]
Next, let > C measure > D; I say that > A will also measure > B.
For, with the same construction, we can prove in a similar manner that > A, > H, > K, > B are continuously proportional in the ratio of > C to > D.
And, since > C measures > D, and, as > C is to > D, so is > A to > H, therefore > A also measures > H, [elem.7.def.20] so that > A measures > B also. Q. E. D.
