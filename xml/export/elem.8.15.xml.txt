Proof:
For let the cube number  measure the cube , and let  be the side of  and  of ; I say that  measures .
For let  by multiplying itself make , and let  by multiplying itself make ; further, let  by multiplying  make , and let ,  by multiplying  make ,  respectively.
Now it is manifest that , ,  and , , ,  are continuously proportional in the ratio of  to . [elem.8.11 elem.8.12]
And, since , , ,  are continuously proportional, and  measures , therefore it also measures . [elem.8.7]
And, as  is to , so is  to ; therefore  also measures . [elem.7.def.20]
Next, let  measure ; I say that  will also measure .
For, with the same construction, we can prove in a similar manner that , , ,  are continuously proportional in the ratio of  to .
And, since  measures , and, as  is to , so is  to , therefore  also measures , [elem.7.def.20] so that  measures  also. Q. E. D.
