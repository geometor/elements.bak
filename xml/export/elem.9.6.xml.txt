Enunciation:
> If a number by multiplying itself make a cube number, it will itself also be cube.

Proof:
For let the number > A by multiplying itself make the cube number > B; I say that > A is also cube.
For let > A by multiplying > B make > C.
Since, then, > A by multiplying itself has made > B, and by multiplying > B has made > C, therefore > C is cube.
And, since > A by multiplying itself has made > B, therefore > A measures > B according to the units in itself.
But the unit also measures > A according to the units in it.
Therefore, as the unit is to > A, so is > A to > B. [elem.7.def.20]
And, since > A by multiplying > B has made > C, therefore > B measures > C according to the units in > A.
But the unit also measures > A according to the units in it.
Therefore, as the unit is to > A, so is > B to > C. [elem.7.def.20]
But, as the unit is to > A, so is > A to > B; therefore also, as > A is to > B, so is > B to > C.
And, since > B, > C are cube, they are similar solid numbers.
Therefore there are two mean proportional numbers between > B, > C. [elem.8.19]
And, as > B is to > C, so is > A to > B.
Therefore there are two mean proportional numbers between > A, > B also. [elem.8.8]
And > B is cube; therefore > A is also cube. [cf. elem.8.23] Q. E. D.
