`In a given circle to inscribe a triangle equiangular with a given triangle`.

Proof:
Let `ABC` be the given circle, and `DEF` the given triangle; thus it is required to inscribe in the circle `ABC` a triangle equiangular with the triangle `DEF`.
Let `GH` be drawn touching the circle `ABC` at `A` [elem.3.16.p.1]; `AH`, and at the point `A` on it, let the angle `HAC` be constructed equal to the angle `DEF`, and on the straight line `AG`, and at the point `A` on it, let the angle `GAB` be constructed equal to the angle `DFE`; [elem.1.23] let `BC` be joined.
Then, since a straight line `AH` touches the circle `ABC`, and from the point of contact at `A` the straight line `AC` is drawn across in the circle, therefore the angle `HAC` is equal to the angle `ABC` in the alternate segment of the circle. [elem.3.32]
But the angle `HAC` is equal to the angle `DEF`; therefore the angle `ABC` is also equal to the angle `DEF`.
For the same reason  therefore the remaining angle `BAC` is also equal to the remaining angle `EDF`. [elem.1.32]
Therefore in the given circle there has been inscribed a triangle equiangular with the given triangle. Q. E. F.
