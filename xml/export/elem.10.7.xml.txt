Enunciation:
> Incommensurable magnitudes have not to one another the ratio which a number has to a number.

Proof:
Let > A, > B be incommensurable magnitudes; I say that > A has not to > B the ratio which a number has to a number.
For, if > A has to > B the ratio which a number has to a number, > A will be commensurable with > B. [elem.10.6]
But it is not; therefore > A has not to > B the ratio which a number has to a number.
Therefore etc.
