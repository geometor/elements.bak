Proof:
Let ,  be two similar plane numbers, and let  by multiplying  make ; I say that  is square.
For let  by multiplying itself make .
Therefore  is square.
Since then  by multiplying itself has made , and by multiplying  has made , therefore, as  is to , so is  to . [elem.7.17]
And, since ,  are similar plane numbers, therefore one mean proportional number falls between , . [elem.8.18]
But, if numbers fall between two numbers in continued proportion, as many as fall between them, so many also fall between those which have the same ratio; [elem.8.8] so that one mean proportional number falls between ,  also.
And  is square; therefore  is also square. [elem.8.22] Q. E. D.
