> If two similar plane numbers by multiplying one another make some number, the product will be square.

Proof:
Let > A, > B be two similar plane numbers, and let > A by multiplying > B make > C; I say that > C is square.
For let > A by multiplying itself make > D.
Therefore > D is square.
Since then > A by multiplying itself has made > D, and by multiplying > B has made > C, therefore, as > A is to > B, so is > D to > C. [elem.7.17]
And, since > A, > B are similar plane numbers, therefore one mean proportional number falls between > A, > B. [elem.8.18]
But, if numbers fall between two numbers in continued proportion, as many as fall between them, so many also fall between those which have the same ratio; [elem.8.8] so that one mean proportional number falls between > D, > C also.
And > D is square; therefore > C is also square. [elem.8.22] Q. E. D.
