Enunciation:
`If a first magnitude have to a second the same ratio as a third has to a fourth`, `and also a fifth have to the second the same ratio as a sixth to the fourth`, `the first and fifth added together will have to the second the same ratio as the third and sixth have to the fourth`.

Proof:
Let a first magnitude `AB` have to a second `C` the same ratio as a third `DE` has to a fourth `F`; and let also a fifth `BG` have to  the second `C` the same ratio as a sixth `EH` has to the fourth `F`; I say that the first and fifth added together, `AG`, will have to the second `C` the same ratio as the third and sixth, `DH`, has to the fourth `F`.
For since, as `BG` is to `C`, so is `EH` to `F`, inversely, as `C` is to `BG`, so is `F` to `EH`.
Since, then, as `AB` is to `C`, so is `DE` to `F`, > and, as `C` is to `BG`, so is `F` to `EH`, therefore, , as `AB` is to `BG`, so is `DE` to `EH`. [elem.5.22]
And, since the magnitudes are proportional , they will also be proportional ; [elem.5.18] > therefore, as `AG` is to `GB`, so is `DH` to `HE`.
But also, as `BG` is to `C`, so is `EH` to `F`; therefore, , as `AG` is to `C`, so is `DH` to `F`. [elem.5.22]
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
