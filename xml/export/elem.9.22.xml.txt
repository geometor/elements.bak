Enunciation:
> If as many odd numbers as we please be added together, and their multitude be even, the whole will be even.

Proof:
For let as many odd numbers as we please, > AB, > BC, > CD, > DE, even in multitude, be added together; I say that the whole > AE is even.
For, since each of the numbers > AB, > BC, > CD, > DE is odd, if an unit be subtracted from each, each of the remainders will be even; [elem.7.def.7] so that the sum of them will be even. [elem.9.21]
But the multitude of the units is also even.
Therefore the whole > AE is also even. [elem.9.21] Q. E. D.
