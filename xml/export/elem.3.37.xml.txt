Enunciation:
`If a point be taken outside a circle and from the point there fall on the circle two straight lines`, `if one of them cut the circle`, `and the other fall on it`, `and if further the rectangle contained by the whole of the straight line which cuts `, `the straight line which falls on it will touch the circle`.

Proof:
For let a point `D` be taken outside the circle `ABC`; from `D` let the two straight lines `DCA`, `DB` fall on the circle `ACB`; let `DCA` cut the circle and `DB` fall on it; and let the rectangle `AD`, `DC` be equal to the square on `DB`.
I say that `DB` touches the circle `ABC`.
For let `DE` be drawn touching `ABC`; let the centre of the circle `ABC` be taken, and let it be `F`; let `FE`, `FB`, `FD` be joined.
Thus the angle `FED` is right. [elem.3.18]
Now, since `DE` touches the circle `ABC`, and `DCA` cuts it, the rectangle `AD`, `DC` is equal to the square on `DE`. [elem.3.36]
But the rectangle `AD`, `DC` was also equal to the square on `DB`; therefore the square on `DE` is equal to the square on `DB`; > therefore `DE` is equal to `DB`.
And `FE` is equal to `FB`; therefore the two sides `DE`, `EF` are equal to the two sides `DB`, `BF`; and `FD` is the common base of the triangles; > therefore the angle `DEF` is equal to the angle `DBF`. [elem.1.8]
But the angle `DEF` is right; > therefore the angle `DBF` is also right.
And `FB` produced is a diameter; and the straight line drawn at right angles to the diameter of a circle, from its extremity, touches the circle; [elem.3.16.p.1] > therefore `DB` touches the circle.
Similarly this can be proved to be the case even if the centre be on `AC`.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
