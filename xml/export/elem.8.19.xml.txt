> Between two similar solid numbers there fall two mean proportional numbers; and the solid number has to the similar solid number the ratio triplicate of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding side.

Proof:
Let > A, > B be two similar solid numbers, and let > C, > D, > E be the sides of > A, and > F, > G, > H of > B.
Now, since similar solid numbers are those which have their sides proportional, [elem.7.def.21] therefore, as > C is to > D, so is > F to > G, > and, as > D is to > E, so is > G to > H.
I say that between > A, > B there fall two mean proportional numbers, and > A has to > B the ratio triplicate of that which > C has to > F, > D to > G, and also > E to > H.
For let > C by multiplying > D make > K, and let > F by multiplying > G make > L.
Now, since > C, > D are in the same ratio with > F, > G, and > K is the product of > C, > D, and > L the product of > F, > G, > K, > L are similar plane numbers; [elem.7.def.21] therefore between > K, > L there is one mean proportional number. [elem.8.18]
Let it be > M
Therefore > M is the product of > D, > F, as was proved in the theorem preceding this. [elem.8.18]
Now, since > D by multiplying > C has made > K, and by multiplying > F has made > M, therefore, as > C is to > F, so is > K to > M. [elem.7.17]
But, as > K is to > M, so is > M to > L.
Therefore > K, > M, > L are continuously proportional in the ratio of > C to > F.
And since, as > C is to > D, so is > F to > G, alternately therefore, as > C is to > F, so is > D to > G. [elem.7.13]
For the same reason also, > as > D is to > G, so is > E to > H.
Therefore > K, > M, > L are continuously proportional in the ratio of > C to > F, in the ratio of > D to > G, and also in the ratio of > E to > H.
Next, let > E, > H by multiplying > M make > N, > O respectively.
Now, since > A is a solid number, and > C, > D, > E are its sides, therefore > E by multiplying the product of > C, > D has made > A.
But the product of > C, > D is > K; therefore > E by multiplying > K has made > A.
For the same reason also > > H by multiplying > L has made > B.
Now, since > E by multiplying > K has made > A, and further also by multiplying > M has made > N, therefore, as > K is to > M, so is > A to > N. [elem.7.17]
But, as > K is to > M, so is > C to > F, > D to > G, and also > E to > H; therefore also, as > C is to > F, > D to > G, and > E to > H, so is > A to > N.
Again, since > E, > H by multiplying > M have made > N, > O respectively, therefore, as > E is to > H, so is > N to > O. [elem.7.18]
But, as > E is to > H, so is > C to > F and > D to > G; therefore also, as > C is to > F, > D to > G, and > E to > H, so is > A to > N and > N to > O.
Again, since > H by multiplying > M has made > O, and further also by multiplying > L has made > B, therefore, as > M is to > L, so is > O to > B. [elem.7.17]
But, as > M is to > L, so is > C to > F, > D to > G, and > E to > H.
Therefore also, as > C is to > F, > D to > G, and > E to > H, so not only is > O to > B, but also > A to > N and > N to > O.
Therefore > A, > N, > O, > B are continuously proportional in the aforesaid ratios of the sides.
I say that > A also has to > B the ratio triplicate of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding side, that is, of the ratio which the number > C has to > F, or > D to > G, and also > E to > H.
For, since > A, > N, > O, > B are four numbers in continued proportion, therefore > A has to > B the ratio triplicate of that which > A has to > N. [elem.5.def.10]
But, as > A is to > N, so it was proved that > C is to > F, > D to > G, and also > E to > H.
Therefore > A also has to > B the ratio triplicate of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding side, that is, of the ratio which the number > C has to > F, > D to > G, and also > E to > H. Q. E. D.
