Enunciation:
> If a number have any part whatever, it will be measured by a number called by the same name as the part.

Proof:
For let the number > A have any part whatever, > B, and let > C be a number called by the same name as the part > B; I say that > C measures > A.
For, since > B is a part of > A called by the same name as > C, and the unit > D is also a part of > C called by the same name as it, therefore, whatever part the unit > D is of the number > C, the same part is > B of > A also; therefore the unit > D measures the number > C the same number of times that > B measures > A.
Therefore, alternately, the unit > D measures the number > B the same number of times that > C measures > A. [elem.7.15]
Therefore > C measures > A. Q. E. D.
