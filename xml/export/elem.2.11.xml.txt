`To cut a given straight line so that the rectangle contained by the whole and one of the segments is equal to the square on the remaining segment`.

Proof:
Let `AB` be the given straight line; thus it is required to cut `AB` so that the rectangle contained by the whole and one of the segments is equal to the square on the remaining segment.
For let the square `ABDC` be described on `AB`; [elem.1.46] let `AC` be bisected at the point `E`, and let `BE` be joined; let `CA` be drawn through to `F`, and let `EF` be made equal to `BE`; let the square `FH` be described on `AF`, and let `GH` be drawn through to `K`.
I say that `AB` has been cut at `H` so as to make the rectangle contained by `AB`, `BH` equal to the square on `AH`.
For, since the straight line `AC` has been bisected at `E`, and `FA` is added to it, > the rectangle contained by `CF`, `FA` together with the square on `AE` is equal to the square on `EF`. [elem.2.6]
But `EF` is equal to `EB`; > therefore the rectangle `CF`, `FA` together with the square on `AE` is equal to the square on `EB`.
But the squares on `BA`, `AE` are equal to the square on `EB`, for the angle at `A` is right; [elem.1.47] > therefore the rectangle `CF`, `FA` together with the square on `AE` is equal to the squares on `BA`, `AE`.
Let the square on `AE` be subtracted from each; > therefore the rectangle `CF`, `FA` which remains is equal to the square on `AB`.
Now the rectangle `CF`, `FA` is `FK`, for `AF` is equal to `FG`; and the square on `AB` is `AD`; > therefore `FK` is equal to `AD`.
Let `AK` be subtracted from each; > therefore `FH` which remains is equal to `HD`.
And `HD` is the rectangle `AB`, `BH`, for `AB` is equal to `BD`; and `FH` is the square on `AH`; > therefore the rectangle contained by `AB`, `BH` is equal to the square on `HA`. therefore the given straight line `AB` has been cut at `H` so as to make the rectangle contained by `AB`, `BH` equal to the square on `HA`.
