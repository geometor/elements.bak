> To find the first binomial straight line.

Proof:
Let two numbers > AC, > CB be set out such that the sum of them > AB has to > BC the ratio which a square number has to a square number, but has not to > CA the ratio which a square number has to a square number; [elem.10.28.l.1]  let any rational straight line > D be set out, and let > EF be commensurable in length with > D.
Therefore > EF is also rational.
Let it be contrived that, as the number > BA is to > AC, so is the square on > EF to the square on > FG. [elem.10.6.p.1]
But > AB has to > AC the ratio which a number has to a number; therefore the square on > EF also has to the square on > FG the ratio which a number has to a number, so that the square on > EF is commensurable with the square on > FG. [elem.10.6]
And > EF is rational; therefore > FG is also rational.
And, since > BA has not to > AC the ratio which a square number has to a square number. neither, therefore, has the square on > EF to the square on > FG the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore > EF is incommensurable in length with > FG. [elem.10.9]
Therefore > EF, > FG are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore > EG is binomial. [elem.10.36]
I say that it is also a first binomial straight line.
For since, as the number > BA is to > AC, so is the square on > EF to the square on > FG, while > BA is greater than > AC, therefore the square on > EF is also greater than the square on > FG.
Let then the squares on > FG, > H be equal to the square on > EF.
Now since, as > BA is to > AC, so is the square on > EF to the square on > FG, therefore, > convertendo, as > AB is to > BC, so is the square on > EF to the square on > H. [elem.5.19.p.1]
But > AB has to > BC the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore the square on > EF also has to the square on > H the ratio which a square number has to a square number.
Therefore > EF is commensurable in length with > H; [elem.10.9] therefore the square on > EF is greater than the square on > FG by the square on a straight line commensurable with > EF.
And > EF, > FG are rational, and > EF is commensurable in length with > D.
Therefore > EF is a first binomial straight line. Q. E. D.
