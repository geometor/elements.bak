Proof:
Let two numbers ,  be set out such that the sum of them  has to  the ratio which a square number has to a square number, but has not to  the ratio which a square number has to a square number; [elem.10.28.l.1]  be set out, and let  be commensurable in length with .
Therefore  is also rational.
Let it be contrived that, as the number  is to , so is the square on  to the square on . [elem.10.6.p.1]
But  has to  the ratio which a number has to a number; therefore the square on  also has to the square on  the ratio which a number has to a number, so that the square on  is commensurable with the square on . [elem.10.6]
And  is rational; therefore  is also rational.
And, since  has not to  the ratio which a square number has to a square number.  to the square on  the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore  is incommensurable in length with . [elem.10.9]
Therefore ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore  is binomial. [elem.10.36]
I say that it is also a first binomial straight line.
For since, as the number  is to , so is the square on  to the square on , while  is greater than , therefore the square on  is also greater than the square on .
Let then the squares on ,  be equal to the square on .
Now since, as  is to , so is the square on  to the square on , therefore, , as  is to , so is the square on  to the square on . [elem.5.19.p.1]
But  has to  the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore the square on  also has to the square on  the ratio which a square number has to a square number.
Therefore  is commensurable in length with ; [elem.10.9] therefore the square on  is greater than the square on  by the square on a straight line commensurable with .
And ,  are rational, and  is commensurable in length with .
Therefore  is a first binomial straight line. Q. E. D.
