Enunciation:
> Cones and cylinders which are on equal bases are to one another as their heights.

Proof:
For let > EB, > FD be cylinders on equal bases, the circles > AB, > CD; I say that, as the cylinder > EB is to the cylinder > FD, so is the axis > GH to the axis > KL.
For let the axis > KL be produced to the point > N, let > LN be made equal to the axis > GH, and let the cylinder > CM be conceived about > LN as axis.
Since then the cylinders > EB, > CM are of the same height, they are to one another as their bases. [elem.12.11]
But the bases are equal to one another; therefore the cylinders > EB, > CM are also equal.
And, since the cylinder > FM has been cut by the plane > CD which is parallel to its opposite planes, therefore, as the cylinder > CM is to the cylinder > FD, so is the axis > LN to the axis > KL. [elem.12.13]
But the cylinder > CM is equal to the cylinder > EB, and the axis > LN to the axis > GH; therefore, as the cylinder > EB is to the cylinder > FD, so is the axis > GH to the axis > KL.
But, as the cylinder > EB is to the cylinder > FD, so is the cone > ABG to the cone > CDK. [elem.12.10]
Therefore also, as the axis > GH is to the axis > KL, so is the cone > ABG to the cone > CDK and the cylinder > EB to the cylinder > FD. Q. E. D.
