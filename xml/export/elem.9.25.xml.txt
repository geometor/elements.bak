> If from an even number an odd number be subtracted, the remainder will be odd.

Proof:
For from the even number > AB let the odd number > BC be subtracted; I say that the remainder > CA is odd.
For let the unit > CD be subtracted from > BC; therefore > DB is even. [elem.7.def.7]
But > AB is also even; therefore the remainder > AD is also even. [elem.9.24]
And > CD is an unit; therefore > CA is odd. [elem.7.def.7] Q. E. D.
