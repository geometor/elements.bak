`If four straight lines be proportional`, `the rectangle contained by the extremes is equal to the rectangle contained by the means; and`, `if the rectangle contained by the extremes be equal to the rectangle contained by the means`, `the four straight lines will be proportional`.

Proof:
Let the four straight lines `AB`, `CD`, `E`, `F` be proportional, so that, as `AB` is to `CD`, so is `E` to `F`; I say that the rectangle contained by `AB`, `F` is equal to the rectangle contained by `CD`, `E`.
Let `AG`, `CH` be drawn from the points `A`, `C` at right angles to the straight lines `AB`, `CD`, and let `AG` be made equal to `F`, and `CH` equal to `E`.
Let the parallelograms `BG`, `DH` be completed.
Then since, as `AB` is to `CD`, so is `E` to `F`, while `E` is equal to `CH`, and `F` to `AG`, therefore, as `AB` is to `CD`, so is `CH` to `AG`.
Therefore in the parallelograms `BG`, `DH` the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional.
But those equiangular parallelograms in which the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional are equal; [elem.6.14] therefore the parallelogram `BG` is equal to the parallelogram `DH`.
And `BG` is the rectangle `AB`, `F`, for `AG` is equal to `F`; and `DH` is the rectangle `CD`, `E`, for `E` is equal to `CH`; therefore the rectangle contained by `AB`, `F` is equal to the rectangle contained by `CD`, `E`.
Next, let the rectangle contained by `AB`, `F` be equal to the rectangle contained by `CD`, `E`; I say that the four straight lines will be proportional, so that, as `AB` is to `CD`, so is `E` to `F`.
For, with the same construction, since the rectangle `AB`, `F` is equal to the rectangle `CD`, `E`, and the rectangle `AB`, `F` is `BG`, for `AG` is equal to `F`, and the rectangle `CD`, `E` is `DH`, for `CH` is equal to `E`, > therefore `BG` is equal to `DH`.
And they are equiangular
But in equal and equiangular parallelograms the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional. [elem.6.14]
Therefore, as `AB` is to `CD`, so is `CH` to `AG`.
But `CH` is equal to `E`, and `AG` to `F`; therefore, as `AB` is to `CD`, so is `E` to `F`.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
