Proof:
For let ,  be the least numbers of those which have the same ratio with , ; I say that  measures  the same number of times that  measures .
Now  is not parts of .
For, if possible, let it be so; therefore  is also the same parts of  that  is of . [elem.7.13 and elem.7.def.20]
Therefore, as many parts of  as there are in , so many parts of  are there also in .
Let  be divided into the parts of , namely , , and  into the parts of , namely , ; thus the multitude of ,  will be equal to the multitude of , .
Now, since the numbers ,  are equal to one another, and the numbers ,  are also equal to one another, while the multitude of ,  is equal to the multitude of , , therefore, as  is to , so is  to .
Therefore also, as one of the antecedents is to one of the consequents, so will all the antecedents be to all the consequents. [elem.7.12]
Therefore, as  is to , so is  to .
Therefore ,  are in the same ratio with , , being less than they: which is impossible, for by hypothesis ,  are the least numbers of those which have the same ratio with them.
Therefore  is not parts of ; therefore it is a part of it. [elem.7.4]
And  is the same part of  that  is of ; [elem.7.13 and elem.7.def.20] therefore  measures  the same number of times that  measures . Q. E. D.
