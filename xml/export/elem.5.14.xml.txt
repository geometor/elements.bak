Enunciation:
`If a first magnitude have to a second the same ratio as a third has to a fourth`, `and the first be greater than the third`, `the second will also be greater than the fourth`; `if equal`, `equal`; `and if less`, `less`.

Proof:
For let a first magnitude `A` have the same ratio to a second `B` as a third `C` has to a fourth `D`; and let `A` be greater than `C`; I say that `B` is also greater than `D`.
For, since `A` is greater than `C`, and `B` is another, chance, magnitude, therefore `A` has to `B` a greater ratio than `C` has to `B`. [elem.5.8]
But, as `A` is to `B`, so is `C` to `D`;
But that to which the same has a greater ratio is less; [elem.5.10]
Similarly we can prove that, if `A` be equal to `C`, `B` will also be equal to `D`; and, if `A` be less than `C`, `B` will also be less than `D`.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
