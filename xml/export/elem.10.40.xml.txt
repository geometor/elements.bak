Proof:
For let two straight lines > AB, > BC incommensurable in square, and fulfilling the given conditions [elem.10.34
], be added together; I say that > AC is irrational.
For, since the sum of the squares on > AB, > BC is medial, while twice the rectangle > AB, > BC is rational, therefore the sum of the squares on > AB, > BC is incommensurable with twice the rectangle > AB, > BC; so that the square on > AC is also incommensurable with twice the rectangle > AB, > BC. [elem.10.16
]
But twice the rectangle > AB, > BC is rational; therefore the square on > AC is irrational.
Therefore > AC is irrational. [elem.10.def.4
]
And let it be called the > side of a rational plus a medial area. Q. E. D.
