> If an area be contained by a rational straight line and the second binomial, the 
 of the area is the irrational straight line which is called a first bimedial.

Proof:
For let the area > ABCD be contained by the rational straight line > AB and the second binomial > AD; I say that the 
 of the area > AC is a first bimedial straight line.
For, since > AD is a second binomial straight line, let it be divided into its terms at > E, so that > AE is the greater term; therefore > AE, > ED are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, the square on > AE is greater than the square on > ED by the square on a straight line commensurable with > AE, and the lesser term > ED is commensurable in length with > AB. [elem.10.def.2.2]
Let > ED be bisected at > F, and let there be applied to > AE the rectangle > AG, > GE equal to the square on > EF and deficient by a square figure; therefore > AG is commensurable in length with > GE. [elem.10.17]
Through > G, > E, > F let > GH, > EK, > FL be drawn parallel to > AB, > CD, let the square > SN be constructed equal to the parallelogram > AH, and the square > NQ equal to > GK, and let them be placed so that > MN is in a straight line with > NO; therefore > RN is also in a straight line with > NP.
Let the square > SQ be completed.
It is then manifest from what was proved before that > MR is a mean proportional between > SN, > NQ and is equal to > EL, and that > MO is the 
 of the area > AC.
It is now to be proved that > MO is a first bimedial straight line.
Since > AE is incommensurable in length with > ED, while > ED is commensurable with > AB, therefore > AE is incommensurable with > AB. [elem.10.13]
And, since > AG is commensurable with > EG, > AE is also commensurable with each of the straight lines > AG, > GE. [elem.10.15]
But > AE is incommensurable in length with > AB; therefore > AG, > GE are also incommensurable with > AB. [elem.10.13]
Therefore > BA, > AG and > BA, > GE are pairs of rational straight lines commensurable in square only; so that each of the rectangles > AH, > GK is medial. [elem.10.21]
Hence each of the squares > SN, > NQ is medial.
Therefore > MN, > NO are also medial.
And, since > AG is commensurable in length with > GE, > AH is also commensurable with > GK, [elem.6.1. elem.10.11] that is, > SN is commensurable with > NQ, that is, the square on > MN with the square on > NO.
And, since > AE is incommensurable in length with > ED, while > AE is commensurable with > AG, and > ED is commensurable with > EF, therefore > AG is incommensurable with > EF; [elem.10.13] so that > AH is also incommensurable with > EL, that is, > SN is incommensurable with > MR, that is, > PN with > NR, [elem.6.1, elem.10.11] that is, > MN is incommensurable in length with > NO.
But > MN, > NO were proved to be both medial and commensurable in square; therefore > MN, > NO are medial straight lines commensurable in square only.
I say next that they also contain a rational rectangle.
For, since > DE is, by hypothesis, commensurable with each of the straight lines > AB, > EF, therefore > EF is also commensurable with > EK. [elem.10.12]
And each of them is rational; therefore > EL, that is, > MR is rational, [elem.10.19] and > MR is the rectangle > MN, > NO.
But, if two medial straight lines commensurable in square only and containing a rational rectangle be added together, the whole is irrational and is called a first bimedial straight line. [elem.10.37]
Therefore > MO is a first bimedial straight line. Q. E. D.
