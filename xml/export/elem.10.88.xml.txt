> To find the fourth apotome.

Proof:
Let a rational straight line > A be set out, and > BG commensurable in length with it; therefore > BG is also rational.
Let two numbers > DF, > FE be set out such that the whole > DE has not to either of the numbers > DF, > EF the ratio which a square number has to a square number.
Let it be contrived that, as > DE is to > EF, so is the square on > BG to the square on > GC; [elem.10.6.p.1] therefore the square on > BG is commensurable with the square on > GC. [elem.10.6]
But the square on > BG is rational; therefore the square on > GC is also rational; therefore > GC is rational.
Now, since > DE has not to > EF the ratio which a square number has to a square number, therefore neither has the square on > BG to the square on > GC the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore > BG is incommensurable in length with > GC. [elem.10.9]
And both are rational; therefore > BG, > GC are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore > BC is an apotome. [elem.10.73]
Now let the square on > H be that by which the square on > BG is greater than the square on > GC.
Since then, as > DE is to > EF, so is the square on > BG to the square on > GC, therefore also, , as > ED is to > DF, so is the square on > GB to the square on > H. [elem.5.19.p.1]
But > ED has not to > DF the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore neither has the square on > GB to the square on > H the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore > BG is incommensurable in length with > H. [elem.10.9]
And the square on > BG is greater than the square on > GC by the square on > H; therefore the square on > BG is greater than the square on > GC by the square on a straight line incommensurable with > BG.
And the whole > BG is commensurable in length with the rational straight line > A set out.
Therefore > BC is a fourth apotome. [elem.10.def.3.4]
Therefore the fourth apotome has been found. Q. E. D.
