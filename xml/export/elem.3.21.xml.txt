Enunciation:
`In a circle the angles in the same segment are equal to one another`.

Proof:
Let `ABCD` be a circle, and let the angles `BAD`, `BED` be angles in the same segment `BAED`; I say that the angles `BAD`, `BED` are equal to one another.
For let the centre of the circle `ABCD` be taken, and let it be `F`; let 
       `BF`, `FD` be joined.
Now, since the angle `BFD` is at the centre, > and the angle `BAD` at the circumference, and they have the same circumference `BCD` as base, therefore the angle `BFD` is double of the angle `BAD`. [elem.3.20]
For the same reason > the angle `BFD` is also double of the angle `BED`; therefore the angle `BAD` is equal to the angle `BED`.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
