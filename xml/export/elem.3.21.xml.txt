Enunciation:
`In a circle the angles in the same segment are equal to one another`.

Proof:
Let `ABCD` be a circle, and let the angles `BAD`, `BED` be angles in the same segment `BAED`; I say that the angles `BAD`, `BED` are equal to one another.
For let the centre of the circle `ABCD` be taken, and let it be `F`; let `BF`, `FD` be joined.
Now, since the angle `BFD` is at the centre,
For the same reason
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
