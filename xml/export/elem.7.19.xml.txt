Enunciation:
> If four numbers be proportional, the number produced from the first and fourth will be equal to the number produced from the second and third; and, if the number produced from the first and fourth be equal to that produced from the second and third, the four numbers will be proportional.

Proof:
Let > A, > B, > C, > D be four numbers in proportion, so that, > as > A is to > B, so is > C to > D; and let > A by multiplying > D make > E, and let > B by multiplying > C make > F; I say that > E is equal to > F.
For let > A by multiplying > C make > G.
Since, then, > A by multiplying > C has made > G, and by multiplying > D has made > E, the number > A by multiplying the two numbers > C, > D has made > G, > E.
Therefore, as > C is to > D, so is > G to > E. [elem.7.17]
But, as > C is to > D, so is > A to > B; therefore also, as > A is to > B, so is > G to > E.
Again, since > A by multiplying > C has made > G, but, further, > B has also by multiplying > C made > F, the two numbers > A, > B by multiplying a certain number > C have made > G, > F.
Therefore, as > A is to > B, so is > G to > F. [elem.7.18]
But further, as > A is to > B, so is > G to > E also; therefore also, as > G is to > E, so is > G to > F.
Therefore > G has to each of the numbers > E, > F the same ratio; > therefore > E is equal to > F. [cf. elem.5.9]
Again, let > E be equal to > F; I say that, as > A is to > B, so is > C to > D.
For, with the same construction, since > E is equal to > F, therefore, as > G is to > E, so is > G to > F. [cf. elem.5.7]
But, as > G is to > E, so is > C to > D, [elem.7.17] > and, as > G is to > F, so is > A to > B. [elem.7.18]
Therefore also, as > A is to > B, so is > C to > D. Q. E. D.
