Proof:
Let , , ,  be four numbers in proportion, so that,  and let  by multiplying  make , and let  by multiplying  make ; I say that  is equal to .
For let  by multiplying  make .
Since, then,  by multiplying  has made , and by multiplying  has made , the number  by multiplying the two numbers ,  has made , .
Therefore, as  is to , so is  to . [elem.7.17]
But, as  is to , so is  to ; therefore also, as  is to , so is  to .
Again, since  by multiplying  has made , but, further,  has also by multiplying  made , the two numbers ,  by multiplying a certain number  have made , .
Therefore, as  is to , so is  to . [elem.7.18]
But further, as  is to , so is  to  also; therefore also, as  is to , so is  to .
Therefore  has to each of the numbers ,  the same ratio;
Again, let  be equal to ; I say that, as  is to , so is  to .
For, with the same construction, since  is equal to , therefore, as  is to , so is  to . [cf. elem.5.7]
But, as  is to , so is  to , [elem.7.17]
Therefore also, as  is to , so is  to . Q. E. D.
