Enunciation:
Out of three straight lines, which are equal to three given straight lines, to construct a triangle: thus it is necessary that two of the straight lines taken together in any manner should be greater than the remaining one. [elem.1.20]

Proof:
Let the three given straight lines be `A`, `B`, `C`, and of these let two taken together in any manner be greater than the remaining one, namely `A`, `B` greater than `C`, > `A`, `C` greater than `B`, and `B`, `C` greater than `A`; thus it is required to construct a triangle out of straight lines equal to `A`, `B`, `C`.
Let there be set out a straight line `DE`, terminated at `D` but of infinite length in the direction of `E`, and let `DF` be made equal to `A`, `FG` equal to `B`, and `GH` equal to `C`. [elem.1.3]
With centre `F` and distance `FD` let the circle `DKL` be described; again, with centre `G` and distance `GH` let the circle `KLH` be described; and let `KF`, `KG` be joined;
I say that the triangle `KFG` has been constructed out of three straight lines equal to `A`, `B`, `C`.
For, since the point `F` is the centre of the circle `DKL`, > `FD` is equal to `FK`.
But `FD` is equal to `A`; > therefore `KF` is also equal to `A`.
Again, since the point `G` is the centre of the circle `LKH`, > `GH` is equal to `GK`.
But `GH` is equal to `C`; > therefore `KG` is also equal to `C`. And `FG` is also equal to `B`; therefore the three straight lines `KF`, `FG`, `GK` are equal to the three straight lines `A`, `B`, `C`.
Therefore out of the three straight lines `KF`, `FG`, `GK`, which are equal to the three given straight lines `A`, `B`, `C`, the triangle `KFG` has been constructed.
