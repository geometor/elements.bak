Enunciation:
`If two triangles have their sides proportional`, `the triangles will be equiangular and will have those angles equal which the corresponding sides subtend`.

Proof:
Let `ABC`, `DEF` be two triangles having their sides proportional, so that,  and further, as `BA` is to `AC`, so is `ED` to `DF`; I say that the triangle `ABC` is equiangular with the triangle `DEF`, and they will have those angles equal which the corresponding sides subtend, namely the angle `ABC` to the angle `DEF`, the angle `BCA` to the angle `EFD`, and further the angle `BAC` to the angle `EDF`.
For on the straight line `EF`, and at the points `E`, `F` on it, let there be constructed the angle `FEG` equal to the angle `ABC`, and the angle `EFG` equal to the angle `ACB`; [elem.1.23]
Therefore the triangle `ABC` is equiangular with the triangle `GEF`.
Therefore in the triangles `ABC`, `GEF` the sides about the equal angles are proportional, and those are corresponding sides which subtend the equal angles; [elem.6.4]
But, as `AB` is to `BC`, so by hypothesis is `DE` to `EF`;
Therefore each of the straight lines `DE`, `GE` has the same ratio to `EF`;
For the same reason
Since then `DE` is equal to `EG`, and `EF` is common,  therefore the angle `DEF` is equal to the angle `GEF`, [elem.1.8] and the triangle `DEF` is equal to the triangle `GEF`, and the remaining angles are equal to the remaining angles, namely those which the equal sides subtend. [elem.1.4]
Therefore the angle `DFE` is also equal to the angle `GFE`,
And, since the angle `FED` is equal to the angle `GEF`, while the angle `GEF` is equal to the angle `ABC`, therefore the angle `ABC` is also equal to the angle `DEF`.
For the same reason  and further, the angle at `A` to the angle at `D`;
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
