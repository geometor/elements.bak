> To find medial straight lines commensurable in square only which contain a rational rectangle.

Proof:
Let two rational straight lines > A, > B commensurable in square only be set out; let > C be taken a mean proportional between > A, > B, [elem.6.13] and let it be contrived that, 
       > as > A is to > B, so is > C to > D. [elem.6.12]
Then, since > A, > B are rational and commensurable in square only, the rectangle > A, > B, that is, the square on > C [elem.6.17], is medial. [elem.10.21]
Therefore > C is medial. [elem.10.21]
And since, as > A is to > B, so is > C to > D, and > A, > B are commensurable in square only, therefore > C, > D are also commensurable in square only. [elem.10.11]
And > C is medial; therefore > D is also medial. [elem.10.23, addition]
Therefore > C, > D are medial and commensurable in square only.
I say that they also contain a rational rectangle.
For since, as > A is to > B, so is > C to > D, therefore, alternately, as > A is to > C, so is > B to > D. [elem.5.16]
But, as > A is to > C, so is > C to > B; therefore also, as > C is to > B, so is > B to > D; therefore the rectangle > C, > D is equal to the square on > B.
But the square on > B is rational; therefore the rectangle > C, > D is also rational.
Therefore medial straight lines commensurable in square only have been found which contain a rational rectangle. Q. E. D.
