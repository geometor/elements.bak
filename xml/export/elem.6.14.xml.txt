Enunciation:
`In equal and equiangular parallelograms the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional; and equiangular parallelograms in which the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional are equal`.

Proof:
Let `AB`, `BC` be equal and equiangular parallelograms having the angles at `B` equal, and let `DB`, `BE` be placed in a straight line; > therefore `FB`, `BG` are also in a straight line. [elem.1.14]
I say that, in `AB`, `BC`, the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional, that is to say, that, as `DB` is to `BE`, so is `GB` to `BF`.
For let the parallelogram `FE` be completed.
Since, then, the parallelogram `AB` is equal to the parallelogram `BC`, > and `FE` is another area, therefore, as `AB` is to `FE`, so is `BC` to `FE`. [elem.5.7]
But, as `AB` is to `FE`, so is `DB` to `BE`, [elem.6.1] and, as `BC` is to `FE`, so is `GB` to `BF`. [`id`.] therefore also, as `DB` is to `BE`, so is `GB` to `BF`. [elem.5.11]
Therefore in the parallelograms `AB`, `BC` the sides about the equal angles are reciprocally proportional.
Next, let `GB` be to `BF` as `DB` to `BE`; I say that the parallelogram `AB` is equal to the parallelogram `BC`.
For since, as `DB` is to `BE`, so is `GB` to `BF`, while, as `DB` is to `BE`, so is the parallelogram `AB` to the parallelogram `FE`, [elem.6.1] and, as `GB` is to `BF`, so is the parallelogram `BC` to the parallelogram `FE`, [elem.6.1] therefore also, as `AB` is to `FE`, so is `BC` to `FE`; [elem.5.11] therefore the parallelogram `AB` is equal to the parallelogram `BC`. [elem.5.9]
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
