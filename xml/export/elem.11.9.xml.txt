Enunciation:
> Straight lines which are parallel to the same straight line and are not in the same plane with it are also parallel to one another.

Proof:
For let each of the straight lines > AB, > CD be parallel to > EF, not being in the same plane with it; I say that > AB is parallel to > CD.
For let a point > G be taken at random on > EF, and from it let there be drawn > GH, in the plane through > EF, > AB, at right angles to > EF, and > GK in the plane through > FE, > CD again at right angles to > EF.
Now, since > EF is at right angles to each of the straight lines > GH, > GK, therefore > EF is also at right angles to the plane through > GH, > GK. [elem.11.4]
And > EF is parallel to > AB; therefore > AB is also at right angles to the plane through > HG, > GK. [elem.11.8]
For the same reason > CD is also at right angles to the plane through > HG, > GK; therefore each of the straight lines > AB, > CD is at right angles to the plane through > HG, > GK.
But if two straight lines be at right angles to the same plane, the straight lines are parallel; [elem.11.6] therefore > AB is parallel to > CD.
