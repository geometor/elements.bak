Proof:
For let each of the straight lines ,  be parallel to , not being in the same plane with it; I say that  is parallel to .
For let a point  be taken at random on , and from it let there be drawn , in the plane through , , at right angles to , and  in the plane through ,  again at right angles to .
Now, since  is at right angles to each of the straight lines , , therefore  is also at right angles to the plane through , . [elem.11.4]
And  is parallel to ; therefore  is also at right angles to the plane through , . [elem.11.8]
For the same reason  is also at right angles to the plane through , ; therefore each of the straight lines ,  is at right angles to the plane through , .
But if two straight lines be at right angles to the same plane, the straight lines are parallel; [elem.11.6] therefore  is parallel to .
