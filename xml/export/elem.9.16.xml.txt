Enunciation:
> If two numbers be prime to one another, the second will not be to any other number as the first is to the second.

Proof:
For let the two numbers > A, > B be prime to one another; I say that > B is not to any other number as > A is to > B.
For, if possible, as > A is to > B, so let > B be to > C.
Now > A, > B are prime, primes are also least, [elem.7.21] and the least numbers measure those which have the same ratio the same number of times, the antecedent the antecedent and the consequent the consequent; [elem.7.20] therefore > A measures > B as antecedent antecedent.
But it also measures itself; therefore > A measures > A, > B which are prime to one another: which is absurd.
Therefore > B will not be to > C, as > A is to > B. Q. E. D.
