Enunciation:
> If two planes which cut one another be at right angles to any plane, > their common section will also be at right angles to the same plane.

Proof:
For let the two planes > AB, > BC be at right angles to the plane of reference, and let > BD be their common section; I say that > BD is at right angles to the plane of reference.
For suppose it is not, and from the point > D let > DE be drawn in the plane > AB at right angles to the straight line > AD, and > DF in the plane > BC at right angles to > CD.
Now, since the plane > AB is at right angles to the plane of reference, and > DE has been drawn in the plane > AB at right angles to > AD, their common section, therefore > DE is at right angles to the plane of reference. [elem.11.def.4]
Similarly we can prove that > DF is also at right angles to the plane of reference.
Therefore from the same point > D two straight lines have been set up at right angles to the plane of reference on the same side: which is impossible. [elem.11.13]
Therefore no straight line except the common section > DB of the planes > AB, > BC can be set up from the point > D at right angles to the plane of reference.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
