Proof:
For let the two planes ,  be at right angles to the plane of reference, and let  be their common section; I say that  is at right angles to the plane of reference.
For suppose it is not, and from the point  let  be drawn in the plane  at right angles to the straight line , and  in the plane  at right angles to .
Now, since the plane  is at right angles to the plane of reference, and  has been drawn in the plane  at right angles to , their common section, therefore  is at right angles to the plane of reference. [elem.11.def.4]
Similarly we can prove that  is also at right angles to the plane of reference.
Therefore from the same point  two straight lines have been set up at right angles to the plane of reference on the same side: which is impossible. [elem.11.13]
Therefore no straight line except the common section  of the planes ,  can be set up from the point  at right angles to the plane of reference.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
