Enunciation:
> The least numbers of those which have the same ratio with them are prime to one another.

Proof:
Let > A, > B be the least numbers of those which have the same ratio with them; I say that > A, > B are prime to one another.
For, if they are not prime to one another, some number will measure them.
Let some number measure them, and let it be > C.
And, as many times as > C measures > A, so many units let there be in > D, and, as many times as > C measures > B, so many units let there be in > E
Since > C measures > A according to the units in > D, therefore > C by multiplying > D has made > A. [elem.7.def.15]
For the same reason also > C by multiplying > E has made > B.
Thus the number > C by multiplying the two numbers > D, > E has made > A, > B; therefore, as > D is to > E, so is > A to > B; [elem.7.17] therefore > D, > E are in the same ratio with > A, > B, being less than they: which is impossible.
Therefore no number will measure the numbers > A, > B.
Therefore > A, > B are prime to one another. Q. E. D.
