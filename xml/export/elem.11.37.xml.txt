Enunciation:
> If four straight lines be proportional, > the parallelepipedal solids on them which are similar and similarly described will also be proportional; and, > if the parallelepipedal solids on them which are similar and similarly described be proportional, > the straight lines will themselves also be proportional.

Proof:
Let > AB, > CD, > EF, > GH be four straight lines in proportion, so that, as > AB is to > CD, so is > EF to > GH; and let there be described on > AB, > CD, > EF, > GH the similar and similarly situated parallelepipedal solids > KA, > LC, > ME, > NG; I say that, as > KA is to > LC, so is > ME to > NG.
For, since the parallelepipedal solid > KA is similar to > LC, therefore > KA has to > LC the ratio triplicate of that which > AB has to > CD. [elem.11.33]
For the same reason > ME also has to > NG the ratio triplicate of that which > EF has to > GH. [> id.]
And, as > AB is to > CD, so is > EF to > GH.
Therefore also, as > AK is to > LC, so is > ME to > NG.
Next, as the solid > AK is to the solid > LC, so let the solid > ME be to the solid > NG; I say that, as the straight line > AB is to > CD, so is > EF to > GH.
For since, again, > KA has to > LC the ratio triplicate of that which > AB has to > CD, [elem.11.33] and > ME also has to > NG the ratio triplicate of that which > EF has to > GH, [> id.] and, as > KA is to > LC, so is > ME to > NG, therefore also, as > AB is to > CD, so is > EF to > GH.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
