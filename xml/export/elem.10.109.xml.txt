> If from a medial area a rational area be subtracted, there arise two other irrational straight lines, either a first apotome of a medial straight line or a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole.

Proof:
For from the medial area > BC let the rational area > BD be subtracted.
I say that the 
 of the remainder > EC becomes one of two irrational straight lines, either a first apotome of a medial straight line or a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole.
For let a rational straight line > FG be set out, and let the areas be similarly applied.
It follows then that > FH is rational and incommensurable in length with > FG, while > KF is rational and commensurable in length with > FG; therefore > FH, > FK are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; [elem.10.13] therefore > KH is an apotome, and > FK the annex to it. [elem.10.73]
Now the square on > HF is greater than the square on > FK either by the square on a straight line commensurable with > HF or by the square on a straight line incommensurable with it.
If then the square on > HF is greater than the square on > FK by the square on a straight line commensurable with > HF, while the annex > FK is commensurable in length with the rational straight line > FG set out, > KH is a second apotome. [elem.10.def.3.2]
But > FG is rational; so that the 
 of > LH, that is, of > EC, is a first apotome of a medial straight line. [elem.10.92]
But, if the square on > HF is greater than the square on > FK by the square on a straight line incommensurable with > HF, while the annex > FK is commensurable in length with the rational straight line > FG set out, > KH is a fifth apotome; [elem.10.def.3.5] so that the 
 of > EC is a straight line which produces with a rational area a medial whole. [elem.10.95]
