Proof:
Let  be the given straight line and  the given parallelepipedal solid; thus it is required to describe on the given straight line  a parallelepipedal solid similar and similarly situated to the given parallelepipedal solid .
For on the straight line  and at the point  on it let the solid angle, contained by the angles , , , be constructed equal to the solid angle at , so that the angle  is equal to the angle , the angle  equal to the angle , and the angle  to the angle ; and let it be contrived that, as  is to , so is  to , and, as  is to , so is  to . [elem.6.12]
Therefore also, , as  is to , so is  to . [elem.5.22]
Let the parallelogram  and the solid  be completed.
Now since, as  is to , so is  to , and the sides about the equal angles ,  are thus proportional,  is similar to the parallelogram .
For the same reason the parallelogram  is also similar to the parallelogram , and further  to ; therefore three parallelograms of the solid  are similar to three parallelograms of the solid .
But the former three are both equal and similar to the three opposite parallelograms, and the latter three are both equal and similar to the three opposite parallelograms; therefore the whole solid  is similar to the whole solid . [elem.11.def.9]
Therefore on the given straight line  there has been described  similar and similarly situated to the given parallelepipedal solid . Q. E. F.
