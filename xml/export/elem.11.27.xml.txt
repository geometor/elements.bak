> On a given straight line to describe a parallelepipedal solid similar and similarly situated to a given parallelepipedal solid.

Proof:
Let > AB be the given straight line and > CD the given parallelepipedal solid; thus it is required to describe on the given straight line > AB a parallelepipedal solid similar and similarly situated to the given parallelepipedal solid > CD.
For on the straight line > AB and at the point > A on it let the solid angle, contained by the angles > BAH, > HAK, > KAB, be constructed equal to the solid angle at > C, so that the angle > BAH is equal to the angle > ECF, the angle > BAK equal to the angle > ECG, and the angle > KAH to the angle > GCF; and let it be contrived that, as > EC is to > CG, so is > BA to > AK, and, as > GC is to > CF, so is > KA to > AH. [elem.6.12]
Therefore also, , as > EC is to > CF, so is > BA to > AH. [elem.5.22]
Let the parallelogram > HB and the solid > AL be completed.
Now since, as > EC is to > CG, so is > BA to > AK, and the sides about the equal angles > ECG, > BAK are thus proportional, therefore the parallelogram > GE is similar to the parallelogram > KB.
For the same reason the parallelogram > KH is also similar to the parallelogram > GF, and further > FE to > HB; therefore three parallelograms of the solid > CD are similar to three parallelograms of the solid > AL.
But the former three are both equal and similar to the three opposite parallelograms, and the latter three are both equal and similar to the three opposite parallelograms; therefore the whole solid > CD is similar to the whole solid > AL. [elem.11.def.9]
Therefore on the given straight line > AB there has been described > AL similar and similarly situated to the given parallelepipedal solid > CD. Q. E. F.
