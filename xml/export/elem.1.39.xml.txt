Enunciation:
Equal triangles which are on the same base and on the same side are also in the same parallels.

Proof:
Let `ABC`, `DBC` be equal triangles which are on the same base `BC` and on the same side of it;
And [For] let `AD` be joined; I say that `AD` is parallel to `BC`.
For, if not, let `AE` be drawn through the point `A` parallel to the straight line `BC`, [elem.1.31] and let `EC` be joined.
Therefore the triangle `ABC` is equal to the triangle `EBC`; for it is on the same base `BC` with it and in the same elem.1.37]
But `ABC` is equal to `DBC`;
Therefore `AE` is not parallel to `BC`.
Similarly we can prove that neither is any other straight line except `AD`;
Therefore etc.
