Enunciation:
> To find medial straight lines commensurable in square only which contain a medial rectangle.

Proof:
Let the rational straight lines > A, > B, > C commensurable in square only be set out; let > D be taken a mean proportional between > A, > B, [elem.6.13] and let it be contrived that, > as > B is to > C, so is > D to > E. [elem.6.12]
Since > A, > B are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, therefore the rectangle > A, > B, that is, the square on > D [elem.6.17], is medial. [elem.10.21]
Therefore > D is medial. [elem.10.21]
And since > B, > C are commensurable in square only, and, as > B is to > C, so is > D to > E, therefore > D, > E are also commensurable in square only. [elem.10.11]
But > D is medial; therefore > E is also medial. [elem.10.23, addition]
Therefore > D, > E are medial straight lines commensurable in square only.
I say next that they also contain a medial rectangle.
For since, as > B is to > C, so is > D to > E, therefore, alternately, as > B is to > D, so is > C to > E. [elem.5.16]
But, as > B is to > D, so is > D to > A; therefore also, as > D is to > A, so is > C to > E; therefore the rectangle > A, > C is equal to the rectangle > D, > E. [elem.6.16]
But the rectangle > A, > C is medial; [elem.10.21] therefore the rectangle > D, > E is also medial.
Therefore medial straight lines commensurable in square only have been found which contain a medial rectangle. Q. E. D.
