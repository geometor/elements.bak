Enunciation:
If two straight lines cut one another, they make the vertical angles equal to one another.

Proof:
For let the straight lines `AB`, `CD` cut one another at the point `E`;
I say that the angle `AEC` is equal to the angle `DEB`, > and the angle `CEB` to the angle `AED`.
For, since the straight line `AE` stands on the straight line `CD`, making the angles `CEA`, `AED`, > the angles `CEA`, `AED` are equal to two right angles [elem.1.13]
Again, since the straight line `DE` stands on the straight line `AB`, making the angles `AED`, `DEB`, > the angles `AED`, `DEB` are equal to two right angles. [elem.1.13]
But the angles `CEA`, `AED` were also proved equal to two right angles; > therefore the angles `CEA`, `AED` are equal to the angles `AED`
         `DEB`. [elem.1.post.4 and elem.1.c.n.1] Let the angle `AED` be subtracted from each; therefore the remaining angle `CEA` is equal to the remaining angle `BED`. [elem.1.c.n.3]
Similarly it can be proved that the angles `CEB`, `DEA` are also equal.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
