> If an area be contained by a rational straight line and a first apotome, the 
 of the area is an apotome.

Proof:
For let the area > AB be contained by the rational straight line > AC and the first apotome > AD;
I say that the 
 of the area > AB is an apotome.
For, since > AD is a first apotome, let > DG be its annex; therefore > AG, > GD are rational straight lines commensurable in square only. [elem.10.73]
And the whole > AG is commensurable with the rational straight line > AC set out, and the square on > AG is greater than the square on > GD by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with > AG; [elem.10.def.3.1] if therefore there be applied to > AG a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on > DG and deficient by a square figure, it divides it into commensurable parts. [elem.10.17]
Let > DG be bisected at > E, let there be applied to > AG a parallelogram equal to the square on > EG and deficient by a square figure, and let it be the rectangle > AF, > FG; therefore > AF is commensurable with > FG.
And through the points > E, > F, > G let > EH, > FI, > GK be drawn parallel to > AC.
Now, since > AF is commensurable in length with > FG, therefore > AG is also commensurable in length with each of the straight lines > AF, > FG. [elem.10.15]
But > AG is commensurable with > AC; therefore each of the straight lines > AF, > FG is commensurable in length with > AC. [elem.10.12]
And > AC is rational; therefore each of the straight lines > AF, > FG is also rational, so that each of the rectangles > AI, > FK is also rational. [elem.10.19]
Now, since > DE is commensurable in length with > EG, therefore > DG is also commensurable in length with each of the straight lines > DE, > EG. [elem.10.15]
But > DG is rational and incommensurable in length with > AC; therefore each of the straight lines > DE, > EG is also rational and incommensurable in length with > AC; [elem.10.13] therefore each of the rectangles > DH, > EK is medial. [elem.10.21]
Now let the square > LM be made equal to > AI, and let there be subtracted the square > NO having a common angle with it, the angle > LPM, and equal to > FK; therefore the squares > LM, > NO are about the same diameter. [elem.6.26]
Let > PR be their diameter, and let the figure be drawn.
Since then the rectangle contained by > AF, > FG is equal to the square on > EG, therefore, as > AF is to > EG, so is > EG to > FG. [elem.6.17]
But, as > AF is to > EG, so is > AI to > EK, and, as > EG is to > FG, so is > EK to > KF; [elem.6.1] therefore > EK is a mean proportional between > AI, > KF. [elem.5.11]
But > MN is also a mean proportional between > LM, > NO, as was before proved, [elem.10.53.l.1] and > AI is equal to the square > LM, and > KF to > NO; therefore > MN is also equal to > EK.
But > EK is equal to > DH, and > MN to > LO; therefore > DK is equal to the gnomon > UVW and > NO.
But > AK is also equal to the squares > LM, > NO; therefore the remainder > AB is equal to > ST.
But > ST is the square on > LN; therefore the square on > LN is equal to > AB; therefore > LN is the 
 of > AB.
I say next that > LN is an apotome.
For, since each of the rectangles > AI, > FK is rational, and they are equal to > LM, > NO, therefore each of the squares > LM, > NO, that is, the squares on > LP, > PN respectively, is also rational; therefore each of the straight lines > LP, > PN is also rational.
Again, since > DH is medial and is equal to > LO, therefore > LO is also medial.
Since then > LO is medial, while > NO is rational, therefore > LO is incommensurable with > NO.
But, as > LO is to > NO, so is > LP to > PN; [elem.6.1] therefore > LP is incommensurable in length with > PN. [elem.10.11]
And both are rational; therefore > LP, > PN are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore > LN is an apotome. [elem.10.73]
And it is the 
 of the area > AB; therefore the 
 of the area > AB is an apotome.
Therefore etc.
