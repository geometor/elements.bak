> The square on the second bimedial straight line applied to a rational straight line produces as breadth the third binomial.

Proof:
Let > AB be a second bimedial straight line divided into its medials at > C, so that > AC is the greater segment; let > DE be any rational straight line, and to > DE let there be applied the parallelogram > DF equal to the square on > AB and producing > DG as its breadth;  I say that > DG is a third binomial straight line.
Let the same construction be made as before shown.
Then, since > AB is a second bimedial divided at > C, therefore > AC, > CB are medial straight lines commensurable in square only and containing a medial rectangle, [elem.10.38] so that the sum of the squares on > AC, > CB is also medial. [elem.10.15 elem.10.23.p.1]
And it is equal to > DL; therefore > DL is also medial.
And it is applied to the rational straight line > DE; therefore > MD is also rational and incommensurable in length with > DE. [elem.10.22]
For the same reason, > MG is also rational and incommensurable in length with > ML, that is, with > DE; therefore each of the straight lines > DM, > MG is rational and incommensurable in length with > DE.
And, since > AC is incommensurable in length with > CB, and, as > AC is to > CB, so is the square on > AC to the rectangle > AC, > CB, therefore the square on > AC is also incommensurable with the rectangle > AC, > CB. [elem.10.11]
Hence the sum of the squares on > AC, > CB is incommensurable with twice the rectangle > AC, > CB, [elem.10.12 elem.10.13] that is, > DL is incommensurable with > MF, so that > DM is also incommensurable with > MG. [elem.6.1, elem.10.11]
And they are rational; therefore > DG is binomial. [elem.10.36]
It is to be proved that it is also a third binomial straight line.
In manner similar to the foregoing we may conclude that > DM is greater than > MG, and that > DK is commensurable with > KM.
And the rectangle > DK, > KM is equal to the square on > MN; therefore the square on > DM is greater than the square on > MG by the square on a straight line commensurable with > DM.
And neither of the straight lines > DM, > MG is commensurable in length with > DE.
Therefore > DG is a third binomial straight line. [elem.10.def.2.3] Q. E. D.
