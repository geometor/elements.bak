Enunciation:
> If two magnitudes have not to one another the ratio which a number has to a number, > the magnitudes will be incommensurable.

Proof:
For let the two magnitudes > A, > B not have to one another the ratio which a number has to a number; I say that the magnitudes > A, > B are incommensurable.
For, if they are commensurable, > A will have to > B the ratio which a number has to a number. [elem.10.5]
But it has not; therefore the magnitudes > A, > B are incommensurable.
Therefore etc.
