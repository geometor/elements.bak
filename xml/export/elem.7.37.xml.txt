Enunciation:
> If a number be measured by any number, the number which is measured will have a part called by the same name as the measuring number.

Proof:
For let the number > A be measured by any number > B; I say that > A has a part called by the same name as > B.
For, as many times as > B measures > A, so many units let there be in > C.
Since > B measures > A according to the units in > C, and the unit > D also measures the number > C according to the units in it, therefore the unit > D measures the number > C the same number of times as > B measures > A.
Therefore, alternately, the unit > D measures the number > B the same number of times as > C measures > A; [elem.7.15] therefore, whatever part the unit > D is of the number > B, the same part is > C of > A also.
But the unit > D is a part of the number > B called by the same name as it; therefore > C is also a part of > A called by the same name as > B, so that > A has a part > C which is called by the same name as > B. Q. E. D.
