Enunciation:


Proof:
For let the number  be measured by any number ; I say that  has a part called by the same name as .
For, as many times as  measures , so many units let there be in .
Since  measures  according to the units in , and the unit  also measures the number  according to the units in it,  measures the number  the same number of times as  measures .
Therefore, alternately, the unit  measures the number  the same number of times as  measures ; [elem.7.15] therefore, whatever part the unit  is of the number , the same part is  of  also.
But the unit  is a part of the number  called by the same name as it; therefore  is also a part of  called by the same name as , so that  has a part  which is called by the same name as . Q. E. D.
