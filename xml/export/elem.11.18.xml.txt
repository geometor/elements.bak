Proof:
For let any straight line  be at right angles to the plane of reference; I say that all the planes through  are also at right angles to the plane of reference.
For let the plane  be drawn through , let  be the common section of the plane  and the plane of reference, let a point  be taken at random on , and from  let  be drawn in the plane  at right angles to . [elem.1.11]
Now, since  is at right angles to the plane of reference,  is also at right angles to all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane of reference; [elem.11.def.3] so that it is also at right angles to ; therefore the angle  is right.
But the angle  is also right; therefore  is parallel to . [elem.1.28]
But  is at right angles to the plane of reference; therefore  is also at right angles to the plane of reference. [elem.11.8]
Now a plane is at right angles to a plane, when the straight lines drawn, in one of the planes, at right angles to the common section of the planes are at right angles to the remaining plane. [elem.11.def.4]
And , drawn in one of the planes  at right angles to , the common section of the planes, was proved to be at right angles to the plane of reference; therefore the plane  is at right angles to the plane of reference.
Similarly also it can be proved that all the planes through  are at right angles to the plane of reference.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
