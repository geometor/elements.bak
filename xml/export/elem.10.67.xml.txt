Enunciation:
> A straight line commensurable in length with a bimedial straight line is itself also bimedial and the same in order.

Proof:
Let > AB be bimedial, and let > CD be commensurable in length with > AB; I say that > CD is bimedial and the same in order with > AB.
For, since > AB is bimedial, let it be divided into its medials at > E; therefore > AE, > EB are medial straight lines commensurable in square only. [elem.10.37 elem.10.38]
And let it be contrived that, as > AB is to > CD, so is > AE to > CF; therefore also the remainder > EB is to the remainder > FD as > AB is to > CD. [elem.5.19]
But > AB is commensurable in length with > CD; therefore > AE, > EB are also commensurable with > CF, > FD respectively. [elem.10.11]
But > AE, > EB are medial; therefore > CF, > FD are also medial. [elem.10.23]
And since, as > AE is to > EB, so is > CF to > FD, [elem.5.11] and > AE, > EB are commensurable in square only, > CF, > FD are also commensurable in square only. [elem.10.11]
But they were also proved medial; therefore > CD is bimedial.
I say next that it is also the same in order with > AB.
For since, as > AE is to > EB, so is > CF to > FD, therefore also, as the square on > AE is to the rectangle > AE, > EB, so is the square on > CF to the rectangle > CF, > FD; therefore, alternately, as the square on > AE is to the square on > CF, so is the rectangle > AE, > EB to the rectangle > CF, > FD. [elem.5.16]
But the square on > AE is commensurable with the square on > CF; therefore the rectangle > AE, > EB is also commensurable with the rectangle > CF, > FD.
If therefore the rectangle > AE, > EB is rational, the rectangle > CF, > FD is also rational, [and for this reason > CD is a first bimedial]; [elem.10.37] but if medial, medial, [elem.10.23.p.1] and each of the straight lines > AB, > CD is a second bimedial. [elem.10.38]
And for this reason > CD will be the same in order with > AB. Q. E. D.
