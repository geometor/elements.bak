Proof:
Let there be a pyramid of which the triangle > ABC is the base and the point > D the vertex; I say that the pyramid > ABCD is divided into two pyramids equal to one another, having triangular bases and similar to the whole pyramid, and into two equal prisms; and the two prisms are greater than the half of the whole pyramid.
For let > AB, > BC, > CA, > AD, > DB, > DC be bisected at the points > E, > F, > G, > H, > K, > L, and let > HE, > EG, > GH, > HK, > KL, > LH, > KF, > FG be joined.
Since > AE is equal to > EB, and > AH to > DH, therefore > EH is parallel to > DB. [elem.6.2]
For the same reason > HK is also parallel to > AB.
Therefore > HEBK is a parallelogram; therefore > HK is equal to > EB. [elem.1.34]
But > EB is equal to > EA; therefore > AE is also equal to > HK.
But > AH is also equal to > HD; therefore the two sides > EA, > AH are equal to the two sides > KH, > HD respectively, and the angle > EAH is equal to the angle > KHD; therefore the base > EH is equal to the base > KD. [elem.1.4]
Therefore the triangle > AEH is equal and similar to the triangle > HKD.
For the same reason the triangle > AHG is also equal and similar to the triangle > HLD.
Now, since two straight lines > EH, > HG meeting one another are parallel to two straight lines > KD, > DL meeting one another, and are not in the same plane, they will contain equal angles. [elem.11.10]
Therefore the angle > EHG is equal to the angle > KDL.
And, since the two straight lines > EH, > HG are equal to the two > KD, > DL respectively, and the angle > EHG is equal to the angle > KDL, therefore the base > EG is equal to the base > KL; [elem.1.4] therefore the triangle > EHG is equal and similar to the triangle > KDL.
For the same reason the triangle > AEG is also equal and similar to the triangle > HKL.
Therefore the pyramid of which the triangle > AEG is the base and the point > H the vertex is equal and similar to the pyramid of which the triangle > HKL is the base and the point > D the vertex. [elem.11.def.10]
And, since > HK has been drawn parallel to > AB, one of the sides of the triangle > ADB, the triangle > ADB is equiangular to the triangle > DHK, [elem.1.29] and they have their sides proportional; therefore the triangle > ADB is similar to the triangle > DHK. [elem.6.def.1]
For the same reason the triangle > DBC is also similar to the triangle > DKL, and the triangle > ADC to the triangle > DLH.
Now, since the two straight lines > BA, > AC meeting one another are parallel to the two straight lines > KH, > HL meeting one another, not in the same plane, they will contain equal angles. [elem.11.10]
Therefore the angle > BAC is equal to the angle > KHL.
And, as > BA is to > AC, so is > KH to > HL; therefore the triangle > ABC is similar to the triangle > HKL.
Therefore also the pyramid of which the triangle > ABC is the base and the point > D the vertex is similar to the pyramid of which the triangle > HKL is the base and the point > D the vertex.
But the pyramid of which the triangle > HKL is the base and the point > D the vertex was proved similar to the pyramid of which the triangle > AEG is the base and the point > H the vertex.
Therefore each of the pyramids > AEGH, > HKLD is similar to the whole pyramid > ABCD.
Next, since > BF is equal to > FC, the parallelogram > EBFG is double of the triangle > GFC.
And since, if there be two prisms of equal height, and one have a parallelogram as base, and the other a triangle, and if the parallelogram be double of the triangle, the prisms are equal, [elem.11.39] therefore the prism contained by the two triangles > BKF, > EHG, and the three parallelograms > EBFG, > EBKH, > HKFG is equal to the prism contained by the two triangles > GFC, > HKL and the three parallelograms > KFCL, > LCGH, > HKFG.
And it is manifest that each of the prisms, namely that in which the parallelogram > EBFG is the base and the straight line > HK is its opposite, and that in which the triangle > GFC is the base and the triangle > HKL its opposite, is greater than each of the pyramids of which the triangles > AEG, > HKL are the bases and the points > H, > D the vertices, inasmuch as, if we join the straight lines > EF, > EK, the prism in which the parallelogram > EBFG is the base and the straight line > HK its opposite is greater than the pyramid of which the triangle > EBF is the base and the point > K the vertex.
But the pyramid of which the triangle > EBF is the base and the point > K the vertex is equal to the pyramid of which the triangle > AEG is the base and the point > H the vertex; for they are contained by equal and similar planes.
Hence also the prism in which the parallelogram > EBFG is the base and the straight line > HK its opposite is greater than the pyramid of which the triangle > AEG is the base and the point > H the vertex.
But the prism in which the parallelogram > EBFG is the base and the straight line > HK its opposite is equal to the prism in which the triangle > GFC is the base and the triangle > HKL its opposite, and the pyramid of which the triangle > AEG is the base and the point > H the vertex is equal to the pyramid of which the triangle > HKL is the base and the point > D the vertex.
Therefore the said two prisms are greater than the said two pyramids of which the triangles > AEG, > HKL are the bases and the points > H, > D the vertices.
Therefore the whole pyramid, of which the triangle > ABC is the base and the point > D the vertex, has been divided into two pyramids equal to one another and into two equal prisms, and the two prisms are greater than the half of the whole pyramid. Q. E. D.
