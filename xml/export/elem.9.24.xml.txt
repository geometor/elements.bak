> If from an even number an even number be subtracted, the remainder will be even.

Proof:
For from the even number > AB let the even number > BC be subtracted: I say that the remainder > CA is even.
For, since > AB is even, it has a half part. [elem.7.def.6]
For the same reason > BC also has a half part; so that the remainder [> CA also has a half part, and] > AC is therefore even. Q. E. D.
