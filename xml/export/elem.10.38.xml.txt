Proof:
For let two medial straight lines ,  commensurable in square only and containing a medial rectangle be added together;  I say that  is irrational.
For let a rational straight line  be set out, and let the parallelogram  equal to the square on  be applied to , producing  as breadth. [elem.1.44
]
Then, since the square on  is equal to the squares on ,  and twice the rectangle , , [elem.2.4
] let , equal to the squares on , , be applied to ; therefore the remainder  is equal to twice the rectangle , .
And, since each of the straight lines ,  is medial, therefore the squares on ,  are also medial.
But, by hypothesis, twice the rectangle ,  is also medial.
And  is equal to the squares on , , while  is equal to twice the rectangle , ; therefore each of the rectangle ,  is medial.
And they are applied to the rational straight line ; therefore each of the straight lines ,  is rational and incommensurable in length with . [elem.10.22
]
Since then  is incommensurable in length with , and, as  is to , so is the square on  to the rectangle , , therefore the square on  is incommensurable with the rectangle , . [elem.10.11
]
But the sum of the squares on ,  is commensurable with the square on , [elem.10.15
] and twice the rectangle ,  is commensurable with the rectangle , . [elem.10.6
]
Therefore the sum of the squares on ,  is incommensurable with twice the rectangle , . [elem.10.13
]
But  is equal to the squares on , , and  is equal to twice the rectangle , .
Therefore  is incommensurable with , so that  is also incommensurable in length with . [elem.6.1
, elem.10.11
]
Therefore ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; so that  is irrational. [elem.10.36
]
But  is rational; and the rectangle contained by an irrational and a rational straight line is irrational; [cf. elem.10.20
] therefore the area  is irrational, and the side of the square equal to it is irrational. [elem.10.def.4
]
But  is the side of the square equal to ; therefore  is irrational.
And let it be called a  straight line. Q. E. D.
