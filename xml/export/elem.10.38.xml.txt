       > straight line.

Proof:
For let two medial straight lines > AB, > BC commensurable in square only and containing a medial rectangle be added together;  I say that > AC is irrational.
For let a rational straight line > DE be set out, and let the parallelogram > DF equal to the square on > AC be applied to > DE, producing > DG as breadth. [elem.1.44
]
Then, since the square on > AC is equal to the squares on > AB, > BC and twice the rectangle > AB, > BC, [elem.2.4
] let > EH, equal to the squares on > AB, > BC, be applied to > DE; therefore the remainder > HF is equal to twice the rectangle > AB, > BC.
And, since each of the straight lines > AB, > BC is medial, therefore the squares on > AB, > BC are also medial.
But, by hypothesis, twice the rectangle > AB, > BC is also medial.
And > EH is equal to the squares on > AB, > BC, while > FH is equal to twice the rectangle > AB, > BC; therefore each of the rectangle > EH, > HF is medial.
And they are applied to the rational straight line > DE; therefore each of the straight lines > DH, > HG is rational and incommensurable in length with > DE. [elem.10.22
]
Since then > AB is incommensurable in length with > BC, and, as > AB is to > BC, so is the square on > AB to the rectangle > AB, > BC, therefore the square on > AB is incommensurable with the rectangle > AB, > BC. [elem.10.11
]
But the sum of the squares on > AB, > BC is commensurable with the square on > AB, [elem.10.15
] and twice the rectangle > AB, > BC is commensurable with the rectangle > AB, > BC. [elem.10.6
]
Therefore the sum of the squares on > AB, > BC is incommensurable with twice the rectangle > AB, > BC. [elem.10.13
]
But > EH is equal to the squares on > AB, > BC, and > HF is equal to twice the rectangle > AB, > BC.
Therefore > EH is incommensurable with > HF, so that > DH is also incommensurable in length with > HG. [elem.6.1
, elem.10.11
]
Therefore > DH, > HG are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; so that > DG is irrational. [elem.10.36
]
But > DE is rational; and the rectangle contained by an irrational and a rational straight line is irrational; [cf. elem.10.20
] therefore the area > DF is irrational, and the side of the square equal to it is irrational. [elem.10.def.4
]
But > AC is the side of the square equal to > DF; therefore > AC is irrational.
And let it be called a > second bimedial straight line. Q. E. D.
