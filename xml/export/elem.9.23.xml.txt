Enunciation:
> If as many odd numbers as we please be added together, and their multitude be odd, the whole will also be odd.

Proof:
For let as many odd numbers as we please, > AB, > BC, > CD, the multitude of which is odd, be added together; I say that the whole > AD is also odd.
Let the unit > DE be subtracted from > CD; therefore the remainder > CE is even. [elem.7.def.7]
But > CA is also even; [elem.9.22] therefore the whole > AE is also even. [elem.9.21]
And > DE is an unit.
Therefore > AD is odd. [elem.7.def.7] Q. E. D.
