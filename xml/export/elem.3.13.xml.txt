Enunciation:
`A circle does not touch a circle at more points than one`, `whether it touch it internally or externally`.

Proof:
For, if possible, let the circle `ABDC` touch the circle `EBFD`, first internally, at more `D`, `B`.
Let the centre `G` of the circle `ABDC`, and the centre `H` of `EBFD`, be taken.
Therefore the straight line `G` to `H` will fall on `B`, `D`. [elem.3.11]
Let it so fall, as `BGHD`.
Then, since the point `G` is the centre of the circle `ABCD`,
Again, since the point `H` is the centre of the circle `EBFD`,
Therefore a circle does not touch a circle internally at more points than one.
I say further that neither does it so touch it externally.
For, if possible, let the circle `ACK` touch the circle `ABDC` at more points than one, namely `A`, `C`, and let `AC` be joined.
Then, since on the circumference of each of the circles `ABDC`, `ACK` two points `A`, `C` have been taken at random, the straight line joining the points will fall within each circle; [elem.3.2]
Therefore a circle does not touch a circle externally at more points than one.
And it was proved that neither does it so touch it internally.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
