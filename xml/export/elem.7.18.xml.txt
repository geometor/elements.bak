Enunciation:
> If two numbers by multiplying any number make certain numbers, the numbers so produced will have the same ratio as the multipliers.

Proof:
For let two numbers > A, > B by multiplying any number > C make > D, > E; I say that, as > A is to > B, so is > D to > E.
For, since > A by multiplying > C has made > D, therefore also > C by multiplying > A has made > D. [elem.7.16] For the same reason also > C by multiplying > B has made > E.
Therefore the number > C by multiplying the two numbers > A, > B has made > D, > E.
Therefore, as > A is to > B, so is > D to > E. [elem.7.17]
