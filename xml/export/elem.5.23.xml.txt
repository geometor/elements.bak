Enunciation:
`If there be three magnitudes`, `and others equal to them in multitude`, `which taken two and two together are in the same ratio`, `and the proportion of them be perturbed`, `they will also be in the same ratio`
       .

Proof:
Let there be three magnitudes `A`, `B`, `C`, and others equal to them in multitude, which, taken two and two together, are in the same proportion, namely `D`, `E`, `F`; and let the proportion of them be perturbed, so that,  and, as `B` is to `C`, so is `D` to `E`; I say that, as `A` is to `C`, so is `D` to `F`.
Of `A`, `B`, `D` let equimultiples `G`, `H`, `K` be taken, and of `C`, `E`, `F` other, chance, equimultiples `L`, `M`, `N`.
Then, since `G`, `H` are equimultiples of `A`, `B`, and parts have the same ratio as the same multiples of them, [elem.5.15]
For the same reason also,  And, as `A` is to `B`, so is `E` to `F`;
Next, since, as `B` is to `C`, so is `D` to `E`, alternately, also, as `B` is to `D`, so is `C` to `E`. [elem.5.16]
And, since `H`, `K` are equimultiples of `B`, `D`, and parts have the same ratio as their equimultiples,
But, as `B` is to `D`, so is `C` to `E`;
Again, since `L`, `M` are equimultiples of `C`, `E`,
But, as `C` is to `E`, so is `H` to `K`;  and, alternately, as `H` is to `L`, so is `K` to `M`. [elem.5.16]
But it was also proved that,
Since, then, there are three magnitudes `G`, `H`, `L`, and others equal to them in multitude `K`, `M`, `N`, which taken two and two together are in the same ratio, and the proportion of them is perturbed, therefore, , if `G` is in excess of `L`, `K` is also in excess of `N`; if equal, equal; and if less, less. [elem.5.21]
And `G`, `K` are equimultiples of `A`, `D`, and `L`, `N` of `C`, `F`.
Therefore, as `A` is to `C`, so is `D` to `F`.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
