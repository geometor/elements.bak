In parallelogrammic areas the opposite sides and angles are equal to one another, and the diameter bisects the areas.

Proof:
Let `ACDB` be a parallelogrammic area, and `BC` its diameter; I say that the opposite sides and angles of the parallelogram `ACDB` are equal to one another, and the diameter `BC` bisects it.
For, since `AB` is parallel to `CD`, and the straight line `BC` has fallen  upon them, > the alternate angles `ABC`, `BCD` are equal to one another. [elem.1.29]
Again, since `AC` is parallel to `BD`, and `BC`has fallen upon them, > the alternate angles `ACB`, `CBD` are equal to one another. [elem.1.29]
Therefore `ABC`, `DCB` are two triangles having the two angles `ABC`, `BCA` equal to the two angles `DCB`, `CBD` respectively, and one side equal to one side, namely that adjoining the equal angles and common to both of them, `BC`; > therefore they will also have the remaining sides equal to the remaining sides respectively, and the remaining angle to the remaining angle; [elem.1.26] therefore the side `AB` is equal to `CD`, and `AC` to `BD`, and further the angle `BAC` is equal to the angle `CDB`.
And, since the angle `ABC` is equal to the angle `BCD`, > and the angle `CBD` to the angle `ACB`, the whole angle `ABD` is equal to the whole angle `ACD`. [elem.1.c.n.2]
        And the angle `BAC` was also proved equal to the angle `CDB`.
Therefore in parallelogrammic areas the opposite sides and angles are equal to one another.
I say, next, that the diameter also bisects the areas.
For, since `AB` is equal to `CD`, and `BC` is common, the two sides `AB`, `BC` are equal to the two sides `DC`, `CB` respectively; > and the angle `ABC` is equal to the angle `BCD`; therefore the base `AC` is also equal to `DB`, and the triangle `ABC` is equal to the triangle `DCB`. [elem.1.4]
Therefore the diameter `BC` bisects the parallelogram `ACDB`.
