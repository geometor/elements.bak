> If a composite number by multiplying any number make some number, the product will be solid.

Proof:
For let the composite number > A by multiplying any number > B make > C; I say that > C is solid.
For, since > A is composite, it will be measured by some number. [elem.7.def.13]
Let it be measured by > D; and, as many times as > D measures > A, so many units let there be in > E.
Since then > D measures > A according to the units in > E, therefore > E by multiplying > D has made > A. [elem.7.def.15]
And, since > A by multiplying > B has made > C, and > A is the product of > D, > E, therefore the product of > D, > E by multiplying > B has made > C.
Therefore > C is solid, and > D, > E, > B are its sides. Q. E. D.
