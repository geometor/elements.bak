Enunciation:
> If a cube number by multiplying any number make a cube number, the multiplied number will also be cube.

Proof:
For let the cube number > A by multiplying any number > B make the cube number > C; I say that > B is cube.
For let > A by multiplying itself make > D; therefore > D is cube. [elem.9.3]
Now, since > A by multiplying itself has made > D, and by multiplying > B has made > C, therefore, as > A is to > B, so is > D to > C. [elem.7.17]
And since > D, > C are cube, they are similar solid numbers.
Therefore two mean proportional numbers fall between > D, > C. [elem.8.19]
And, as > D is to > C, so is > A to > B; therefore two mean proportional numbers fall between > A, > B also. [elem.8.8]
And > A is cube; therefore > B is also cube. [elem.8.23]
