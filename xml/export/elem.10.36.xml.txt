Proof:
For let two rational straight lines > AB, > BC commensurable in square only be added together;  I say that the whole > AC is irrational.
For, since > AB is incommensurable in length with > BC— for they are commensurable in square only— and, as > AB is to > BC, so is the rectangle > AB, > BC to the square on > BC, therefore the rectangle > AB, > BC is incommensurable with the square on > BC. [elem.10.11
]
But twice the rectangle > AB, > BC is commensurable with the rectangle > AB, > BC [elem.10.6
], and the squares on > AB, > BC are commensurable with the square on > BC—for > AB, > BC are rational straight lines commensurable in square only— [elem.10.15
] therefore twice the rectangle > AB, > BC is incommensurable with the squares on > AB, > BC. [elem.10.13
]
And, , twice the rectangle > AB, > BC together with the squares on > AB, > BC, that is, the square on > AC [elem.2.4
], is incommensurable with the sum of the squares on > AB, > BC. [elem.10.16
]
But the sum of the squares on > AB, > BC is rational; therefore the square on > AC is irrational, so that > AC is also irrational. [elem.10.def.4
]
And let it be called > binomial.
