Proof:
For let two rational straight lines ,  commensurable is irrational.
For, since  is incommensurable in length with —  is to , so is the rectangle ,  to the square on , therefore the rectangle ,  is incommensurable with the square on . [elem.10.11
]
But twice the rectangle ,  is commensurable with the rectangle ,  [elem.10.6
], and the squares on ,  are commensurable with the square on —for ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only— [elem.10.15
] therefore twice the rectangle ,  is incommensurable , . [elem.10.13
]
And, , twice the rectangle ,  together with the squares on , , that is, the square on  [elem.2.4
], is incommensurable with the sum of the squares on , . [elem.10.16
]
But the sum of the squares on ,  is rational;  is irrational, so that  is also irrational. [elem.10.def.4
]
And let it be called .
