> 4 medial area does not exceed a medial area by a rational area.

Proof:
For, if possible, let the medial area > AB exceed the medial area > AC by the rational area > DB,  and let a rational straight line > EF be set out; to > EF let there be applied the rectangular parallelogram > FH equal to > AB, producing > EH as breadth, and let the rectangle > FG equal to > AC be subtracted; therefore the remainder > BD is equal to the remainder > KH.
But > DB is rational; therefore > KH is also rational.
Since, then, each of the rectangles > AB, > AC is medial, and > AB is equal to > FH, and > AC to > FG, therefore each of the rectangles > FH, > FG is also medial.
And they are applied to the rational straight line > EF; therefore each of the straight lines > HE, > EG is rational and incommensurable in length with > EF. [elem.10.22]
And, since [> DB is rational and is equal to > KH, therefore] > KH is [also] rational; and it is applied to the rational straight line > EF; therefore > GH is rational and commensurable in length with > EF. [elem.10.20]
But > EG is also rational, and is incommensurable in length with > EF; therefore > EG is incommensurable in length with > GH. [elem.10.13]
And, as > EG is to > GH, so is the square on > EG to the rectangle > EG, > GH; therefore the square on > EG is incommensurable with the rectangle > EG, > GH. [elem.10.11]
But the squares on > EG, > GH are commensurable with the square on > EG, for both are rational; and twice the rectangle > EG, > GH is commensurable with the rectangle > EG, > GH, for it is double of it; [elem.10.6] therefore the squares on > EG, > GH are incommensurable with twice the rectangle > EG, > GH; [elem.10.13] therefore also the sum of the squares on > EG, > GH and twice the rectangle > EG, > GH, that is, the square on > EH [elem.2.4], is incommensurable with the squares on > EG, > GH. [elem.10.16]
But the squares on > EG, > GH are rational; therefore the square on > EH is irrational. [elem.10.def.4]
Therefore > EH is irrational.
But it is also rational: which is impossible.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
