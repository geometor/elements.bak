Proof:
For, if possible, let the medial area  exceed the medial area  by the rational area ,  be set out; to  let there be applied the rectangular parallelogram  equal to , producing  as breadth, and let the rectangle  equal to  be subtracted; therefore the remainder  is equal to the remainder .
But  is rational; therefore  is also rational.
Since, then, each of the rectangles ,  is medial, and  is equal to , and  to , therefore each of the rectangles ,  is also medial.
And they are applied to the rational straight line ; therefore each of the straight lines ,  is rational and incommensurable in length with . [elem.10.22]
And, since [ is rational and is equal to , therefore]  is [also] rational; and it is applied to the rational straight line ;  is rational and commensurable in length with . [elem.10.20]
But  is also rational, and is incommensurable in length with ; therefore  is incommensurable in length with . [elem.10.13]
And, as  is to , so is the square on  to the rectangle , ; therefore the square on  is incommensurable with the rectangle , . [elem.10.11]
But the squares on ,  are commensurable with the square on , for both are rational; and twice the rectangle ,  is commensurable with the rectangle , , for it is double of it; [elem.10.6] therefore the squares on ,  are incommensurable with twice the rectangle , ; [elem.10.13] therefore also the sum of the squares on ,  and twice the rectangle , , that is, the square on  [elem.2.4], is incommensurable with the squares on , . [elem.10.16]
But the squares on ,  are rational; therefore the square on  is irrational. [elem.10.def.4]
Therefore  is irrational.
But it is also rational: which is impossible.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
