Proof:
For let  be a first apotome of a medial straight line, and let  be an annex to ; therefore ,  are medial straight lines commensurable in square only and such that the rectangle ,  which they contain is rational; [elem.10.74] I say that no other medial straight line can be annexed to  which is commensurable with the whole in square only and which contains with the whole a rational area.
For, if possible, let  also be so annexed; therefore ,  are medial straight lines commensurable in square only and such that the rectangle ,  which they contain is rational. [elem.10.74]
Now, since the excess of the squares on ,  over twice the rectangle ,  is also the excess of the squares on ,  over twice the rectangle , , for they exceed by the same, the square on , [elem.2.7] therefore, alternately, the excess of the squares on ,  over the squares on ,  is also the excess of twice the rectangle ,  over twice the rectangle , .
But twice the rectangle ,  exceeds twice the rectangle ,  by a rational area, for both are rational.
Therefore the squares on ,  also exceed the squares on ,  by a rational area. which is impossible, for both are medial [elem.10.15 elem.10.23.p.1], and a medial area does not exceed a medial by a rational area. [elem.10.26]
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
