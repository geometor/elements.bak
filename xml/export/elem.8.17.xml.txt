Enunciation:
> If a cube number do not measure a cube number, neither will the side measure the side; and, if the side do not measure the side, neither will the cube measure the cube.

Proof:
For let the cube number > A not measure the cube number > B, and let > C be the side of > A, and > D of > B; I say that > C will not measure > D.
For if > C measures > D, > A will also measure > B. [elem.8.15]
But > A does not measure > B; therefore neither does > C measure > D.
Again, let > C not measure > D; I say that neither will > A measure > B.
For, if > A measures > B, > C will also measure > D. [elem.8.15]
But > C does not measure > D; therefore neither will > A measure > B. Q. E. D.
