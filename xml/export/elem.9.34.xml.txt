Proof:
For let the number  neither be one of those doubled from a dyad, nor have its half odd; I say that  is both even-times even and even-times odd.
Now that  is even-times even is manifest; for it has not its half odd. [elem.7.def.8]
I say next that it is also even-times odd.
For, if we bisect , then bisect its half, and do this continually, we shall come upon some odd number which will measure  according to an even number.
For, if not, we shall come upon a dyad, and  will be among those which are doubled from a dyad: which is contrary to the hypothesis.
Thus  is even-times odd.
But it was also proved even-times even.
Therefore  is both even-times even and even-times odd. Q. E. D.
