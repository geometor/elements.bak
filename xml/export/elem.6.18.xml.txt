Enunciation:
`On a given straight line to describe a rectilineal figure similar and similarly situated to a given rectilineal figure`.

Proof:
Let `AB` be the given straight line and `CE` the given rectilineal figure; thus it is required to describe on the straight line `AB` a rectilineal figure similar and similarly situated to the rectilineal figure `CE`.
Let `DF` be joined, and on the straight line `AB`, and at the points `A`, `B` on it, let the angle `GAB` be constructed equal to the angle at `C`, and the angle `ABG` equal to the angle `CDF`. [elem.1.23]
Therefore the remaining angle `CFD` is equal to the angle `AGB`; [elem.1.32] > therefore the triangle `FCD` is equiangular with the triangle `GAB`.
Therefore, proportionally, as `FD` is to `GB`, so is `FC` to `GA`, and `CD` to `AB`.
Again, on the straight line `BG`, and at the points `B`, `G` on it, let the angle `BGH` be constructed equal to the angle `DFE`, and the angle `GBH` equal to the angle `FDE`. [elem.1.23]
Therefore the remaining angle at `E` is equal to the remaining angle at `H`; [elem.1.32] > therefore the triangle `FDE` is equiangular with the triangle `GBH`; therefore, proportionally, as `FD` is to `GB`, so is `FE` to `GH`, and `ED` to `HB`. [elem.6.4]
But it was also proved that, as `FD` is to `GB`, so is `FC` to `GA`, and `CD` to `AB`; > therefore also, as `FC` is to `AG`, so is `CD` to `AB`, and `FE` to `GH`, and further `ED` to `HB`.
And, since the angle `CFD` is equal to the angle `AGB`, and the angle `DFE` to the angle `BGH`, therefore the whole angle `CFE` is equal to the whole angle `AGH`.
For the same reason > the angle `CDE` is also equal to the angle `ABH`.
And the angle at `C` is also equal to the angle at `A`, > and the angle at `E` to the angle at `H`.
Therefore `AH` is equiangular with `CE`; and they have the sides about their equal angles proportional; > therefore the rectilineal figure `AH` is similar to the rectilineal figure `CE`. [elem.6.def.1]
Therefore on the given straight line `AB` the rectilineal figure `AH` has been described similar and similarly situated to the given rectilineal figure `CE`. Q. E. F.
