> Given two circles about the same centre, > to inscribe in the greater circle an equilateral polygon with an even number of sides which does not touch the lesser circle.

Proof:
Let > ABCD, > EFGH be the two given circles about the same centre > K; thus it is required to inscribe in the greater circle > ABCD an equilateral polygon with an even number of sides which does not touch the circle > EFGH.
For let the straight line > BKD be drawn through the centre > K, and from the point > G let > GA be drawn at right angles to the straight line > BD and carried through to > C; therefore > AC touches the circle > EFGH. [elem.3.16.p.1]
Then, bisecting the circumference > BAD, bisecting the half of it, and doing this continually, we shall leave a circumference less than > AD. [elem.10.1]
Let such be left, and let it be > LD; from > L let > LM be drawn perpendicular to > BD and carried through to > N, and let > LD, > DN be joined; therefore > LD is equal to > DN. [elem.3.3, elem.1.4]
Now, since > LN is parallel to > AC, and > AC touches the circle > EFGH, therefore > LN does not touch the circle > EFGH; therefore > LD, > DN are far from touching the circle > EFGH.
If then we fit into the circle > ABCD straight lines equal to the straight line > LD and placed continuously, there will be inscribed in the circle > ABCD an equilateral polygon with an even number of sides which does not touch the lesser circle > EFGH. Q. E. F.
