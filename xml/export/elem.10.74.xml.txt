Enunciation:
> If from a medial straight line there be subtracted a medial straight line which is commensurable with the whole in square only, and which contains with the whole a rational rectangle, the remainder is irrational. And let it be called a
       > first apotome of a medial
       > straight line.

Proof:
For from the medial straight line > AB let there be subtracted the medial straight line > BC which is commensurable with > AB in square only and with > AB makes the rectangle > AB, > BC rational;  I say that the remainder > AC is irrational; and let it be called a > first apotome of a medial straight line.
For, since > AB, > BC are medial, the squares on > AB, > BC are also medial.
But twice the rectangle > AB, > BC is rational; therefore the squares on > AB, > BC are incommensurable with twice the rectangle > AB, > BC; therefore twice the rectangle > AB, > BC is also incommensurable with the remainder, the square on > AC, [Cf. elem.2.7] since, if the whole is incommensurable with one of the magnitudes, the original magnitudes will also be incommensurable. [elem.10.16]
But twice the rectangle > AB, > BC is rational; therefore the square on > AC is irrational; therefore > AC is irrational. [elem.10.def.4]
And let it be called a > first apotome of a medial straight line.
