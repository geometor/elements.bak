`About a given triangle to circumscribe a circle`.

Proof:
Let `ABC` be the given triangle; thus it is required to circumscribe a circle about the given triangle `ABC`.
Let the straight lines `AB`, `AC` be bisected at the points `D`, `E` [elem.1.10], and from the points `D`, `E` let `DF`, `EF` be drawn at right angles to `AB`, `AC`; they will then meet within the triangle `ABC`, or on the straight line `BC`, or outside `BC`.
First let them meet within at `F`, and let `FB`, `FC`, `FA` be joined.
Then, since `AD` is equal to `DB`, and `DF` is common and at right angles, therefore the base `AF` is equal to the base `FB`. [elem.1.4]
Similarly we can prove that  so that `FB` is also equal to `FC`;
Therefore the circle described with centre `F` and distance one of the straight lines `FA`, `FB`, `FC` will pass also through the remaining points, and the circle will have been circumscribed about the triangle `ABC`.
Let it be circumscribed, as `ABC`.
Next, let `DF`, `EF` meet on the straight line `BC` at `F`, as is the case in the second figure; and let `AF` be joined.
Then, similarly, we shall prove that the point `F` is the centre of the circle circumscribed about the triangle `ABC`.
Again, let `DF`, `EF` meet outside the triangle `ABC` at `F`, as is the case in the third figure, and let `AF`, `BF`, `CF` be joined.
Then again, since `AD` is equal to `DB`, and `DF` is common and at right angles, therefore the base `AF` is equal to the base `BF`. [elem.1.4]
Similarly we can prove that  so that `BF` is also equal to `FC`; therefore the circle described with centre `F` and distance one of the straight lines `FA`, `FB`, `FC` will pass also through the remaining points, and will have been circumscribed about the triangle `ABC`.
Therefore about the given triangle a circle has been circumscribed. Q. E. F.
And it is manifest that, when the centre of the circle falls within the triangle, the angle `BAC`, being in a segment greater than the semicircle, is less than a right angle; `BC`, the angle `BAC`, being in a semicircle, is right; and when the centre of the circle falls outside the triangle, the angle `BAC`, being in a segment less than the semicircle, is greater than a right angle.
