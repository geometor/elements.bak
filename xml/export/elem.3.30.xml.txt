Enunciation:
`To bisect a given circumference`.

Proof:
Let `ADB` be the given circumference; thus it is required to bisect the circumference `ADB`.
Let `AB` be joined and bisected at `C`; from the point `C` let `CD` be drawn at right angles to the straight line `AB`, `AD`, `DB` be joined.
Then, since `AC` is equal to `CB`, and `CD` is common,  and the angle `ACD` is equal to the angle `BCD`, for each is right;
But equal straight lines cut off equal circumferences, the greater equal to the greater, and the less to the less; [elem.3.28]
Therefore the given circumference has been bisected at the point `D`. Q. E. F.
