Enunciation:
`To bisect a given circumference`.

Proof:
Let `ADB` be the given circumference; thus it is required to bisect the circumference `ADB`.
Let `AB` be joined and bisected at `C`; from the point `C` let `CD` be drawn at right angles to the straight line `AB`,  and let `AD`, `DB` be joined.
Then, since `AC` is equal to `CB`, and `CD` is common, > the two sides `AC`, `CD` are equal to the two sides `BC`, `CD`; and the angle `ACD` is equal to the angle `BCD`, for each is right; > therefore the base `AD` is equal to the base `DB`. [elem.1.4]
But equal straight lines cut off equal circumferences, the greater equal to the greater, and the less to the less; [elem.3.28] > and each of the circumferences `AD`, `DB` is less than a semicircle; therefore the circumference `AD` is equal to the circumference `DB`.
Therefore the given circumference has been bisected at the point `D`. Q. E. F.
