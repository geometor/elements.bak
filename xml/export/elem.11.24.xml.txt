> If a solid be contained by parallel planes, > the opposite planes in it are equal and parallelogrammic.

Proof:
For let the solid > CDHG be contained by the parallel planes > AC, > GF, > AH, > DF, > BF, > AE; I say that the opposite planes in it are equal and parallelogrammic.
For, since the two parallel planes > BG, > CE are cut by the plane > AC, their common sections are parallel. [elem.11.16]
Therefore > AB is parallel to > DC.
Again, since the two parallel planes > BF, > AE are cut by the plane > AC, their common sections are parallel. [elem.11.16]
Therefore > BC is parallel to > AD.
But > AB was also proved parallel to > DC; therefore > AC is a parallelogram.
Similarly we can prove that each of the planes > DF, > FG, > GB, > BF, > AE is a parallelogram.
Let > AH, > DF be joined.
Then, since > AB is parallel to > DC, and > BH to > CF, the two straight lines > AB, > BH which meet one another are parallel to the two straight lines > DC, > CF which meet one another, not in the same plane; therefore they will contain equal angles; [elem.11.10] therefore the angle > ABH is equal to the angle > DCF.
And, since the two sides > AB, > BH are equal to the two sides > DC, > CF, [elem.1.34] and the angle > ABH is equal to the angle > DCF, therefore the base > AH is equal to the base > DF, and the triangle > ABH is equal to the triangle > DCF. [elem.1.4]
And the parallelogram > BG is double of the triangle > ABH, and the parallelogram > CE double of the triangle > DCF; [elem.1.34] therefore the parallelogram > BG is equal to the parallelogram > CE.
Similarly we can prove that > AC is also equal to > GF, and > AE to > BF.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
