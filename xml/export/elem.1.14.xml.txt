Enunciation:
If with any straight line, and at a point on it, two straight lines not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles equal to two right angles, the two straight lines will be in a straight line with one another.

Proof:
For with any straight line `AB`, and at the point `B` on it, let the two straight lines `BC`, `BD` not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles `ABC`, `ABD` equal to two right angles;
I say that `BD` is in a straight line with `CB`.
For, if `BD` is not in a straight line with `BC`, let `BE` be in a straight line with `CB`.
Then, since the straight line `AB` stands on the straight line `CBE`,  But the angles `ABC`, `ABD` are also equal to two right angles;
Let the angle `CBA` be subtracted from each; `ABE` is equal to the remaining angle `ABD`, [elem.1.c.n.3]
Similarly we can prove that neither is any other straight `BD`.
Therefore etc.
