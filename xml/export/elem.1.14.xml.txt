Enunciation:
If with any straight line, and at a point on it, two straight lines not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles equal to two right angles, the two straight lines will be in a straight line with one another.

Proof:
For with any straight line `AB`, and at the point `B` on it, let the two straight lines `BC`, `BD` not lying on the same side make the adjacent angles `ABC`, `ABD` equal to two right angles;
I say that `BD` is in a straight line with `CB`.
For, if `BD` is not in a straight line with `BC`, let `BE` be in a straight line with `CB`.
Then, since the straight line `AB` stands on the straight line `CBE`, 
        > the angles `ABC`, `ABE` are equal to two right angles. [elem.1.13] But the angles `ABC`, `ABD` are also equal to two right angles; > therefore the angles `CBA`, `ABE` are equal to the angles `CBA`, `ABD`. [elem.1.post.4 and elem.1.c.n.1]
Let the angle `CBA` be subtracted from each; therefore the remaining angle `ABE` is equal to the remaining angle `ABD`, [elem.1.c.n.3] > the less to the greater: which is impossible. Therefore `BE` is not in a straight line with `CB`.
Similarly we can prove that neither is any other straight line except `BD`. > Therefore `CB` is in a straight line with `BD`.
Therefore etc.
