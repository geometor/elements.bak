Enunciation:
Parallelograms which are on equal bases and in the same parallels are equal to one another.

Proof:
Let `ABCD`, `EFGH` be parallelograms which are on equal bases `BC`, `FG` and in the same parallels `AH`, `BG`;  I say that the parallelogram `ABCD` is equal to `EFGH`.
For let `BE`, `CH` be joined.
Then, since `BC` is equal to `FG` while `FG` is equal to `EH`,
But they are also parallel.
And `EB`, `HC` join them; but straight lines joining equal and parallel straight lines (at the extremities which are) in the same directions (respectively) are equal and parallel. [elem.1.33]
Therefore `EBCH` is a parallelogram. [elem.1.34]
And it is equal to `ABCD`; for it has the same base `BC` with it, and is in the same parallels `BC`, `AH` with it. [elem.1.35]
For the same reason also `EFGH` is equal to the same `EBCH`; [elem.1.35] so that the parallelogram `ABCD` is also equal to `EFGH`. [elem.1.c.n.1]
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
