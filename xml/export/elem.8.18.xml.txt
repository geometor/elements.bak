> Between two similar plane numbers there is one mean proportional number; and the plane number has to the plane number the ratio duplicate of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding side.

Proof:
Let > A, > B be two similar plane numbers, and let the numbers > C, > D be the sides of > A, and > E, > F of > B.
Now, since similar plane numbers are those which have their sides proportional, [elem.7.def.21] therefore, as > C is to > D, so is > E to > F.
I say then that between > A, > B there is one mean proportional number, and > A has to > B the ratio duplicate of that which > C has to > E, or > D to > F, that is, of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding side.
Now since, as > C is to > D, so is > E to > F, therefore, alternately, as > C is to > E, so is > D to > F. [elem.7.13]
And, since > A is plane, and > C, > D are its sides, therefore > D by multiplying > C has made > A.
For the same reason also > E by multiplying > F has made > B.
Now let > D by multiplying > E make > G.
Then, since > D by multiplying > C has made > A, and by multiplying > E has made > G, therefore, as > C is to > E, so is > A to > G. [elem.7.17]
But, as > C is to > E, so is > D to > F; therefore also, as > D is to > F, so is > A to > G.
Again, since > E by multiplying > D has made > G, and by multiplying > F has made > B, therefore, as > D is to > F, so is > G to > B. [elem.7.17]
But it was also proved that, > as > D is to > F, so is > A to > G; therefore also, as > A is to > G, so is > G to > B.
Therefore > A, > G, > B are in continued proportion.
Therefore between > A, > B there is one mean proportional number.
I say next that > A also has to > B the ratio duplicate of that which the corresponding side has to the corresponding side, that is, of that which > C has to > E or > D to > F.
For, since > A, > G, > B are in continued proportion, > A has to > B the ratio duplicate of that which it has to > G. [elem.5.def.9]
And, as > A is to > G, so is > C to > E, and so is > D to > F.
Therefore > A also has to > B the ratio duplicate of that which > C has to > E or > D to > F. Q. E. D.
