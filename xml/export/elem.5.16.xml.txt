Enunciation:
`If four magnitudes be proportional`, `they will also be proportional alternately`.

Proof:
Let `A`, `B`, `C`, `D` be four proportional magnitudes, so that, as `A` is to `B`, so is `C` to `D`; I say that they will also be so alternately, that is, as `A` is to `C`, so is `B` to `D`.
For of `A`, `B` let equimultiples `E`, `F` be taken, and of `C`, `D` other, chance, equimultiples `G`, `H`.
Then, since `E` is the same multiple of `A` that `F` is of `B`, and parts have the same ratio as the same multiples of them, [elem.5.15] therefore, as `A` is to `B`, so is `E` to `F`.
But as `A` is to `B`, so is `C` to `D`; therefore also, as `C` is to `D`, so is `E` to `F`. [elem.5.11]
Again, since `G`, `H` are equimultiples of `C`, `D`, therefore, as `C` is to `D`, so is `G` to `H`. [elem.5.15]
But, as `C` is to `D`, so is `E` to `F`; therefore also, as `E` is to `F`, so is `G` to `H`. [elem.5.11]
But, if four magnitudes be proportional, and the first be greater than the third, > the second will also be greater than the fourth; if equal, equal; and if less, less. [elem.5.14]
Therefore, if `E` is in excess of `G`, `F` is also in excess of `H`, if equal, equal, and if less, less.
Now `E`, `F` are equimultiples of `A`, `B`, and `G`, `H` other, chance, equimultiples of `C`, `D`; > therefore, as `A` is to `C`, so is `B` to `D`. [elem.5.def.5]
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
