Enunciation:
`On a given straight line to describe a segment of a circle admitting an angle equal to a given rectilineal angle`.

Proof:
Let `AB` be the given straight line, and the angle at `C` the given rectilineal angle; thus it is required to describe on the given straight line `AB` a segment of a circle admitting an angle equal to the angle at `C`.
The angle at `C` is then acute, or right, or obtuse.
First let it be acute, and, as in the first figure, on the straight line `AB`, and at the point `A`, let the angle `BAD` be constructed equal to the angle at `C`; > therefore the angle `BAD` is also acute.
Let `AE` be drawn at right angles to `DA`, let `AB` be bisected at `F`, let `FG` be drawn from the point `F` at right angles to `AB`, and let `GB` be joined.
Then, since `AF` is equal to `FB`, and `FG` is common, > the two sides `AF`, `FG` are equal to the two sides `BF`, `FG`; and the angle `AFG` is equal to the angle `BFG`; > therefore the base `AG` is equal to the base `BG`. [elem.1.4]
Therefore the circle described with centre `G` and distance `GA` will pass through `B` also.
Let it be drawn, and let it be `ABE`; let `EB` be joined.
Now, since `AD` is drawn from `A`, the extremity of the diameter `AE`, at right angles to `AE`, > therefore `AD` touches the circle `ABE`. [elem.3.16.p.1]
Since then a straight line `AD` touches the circle `ABE`, and from the point of contact at `A` a straight line `AB` is drawn across in the circle `ABE`, > the angle `DAB` is equal to the angle `AEB` in the alternate segment of the circle. [elem.3.32]
But the angle `DAB` is equal to the angle at `C`; therefore the angle at `C` is also equal to the angle `AEB`.
Therefore on the given straight line `AB` the segment `AEB` of a circle has been described admitting the angle `AEB` equal to the given angle, the angle at `C`.
Next let the angle at `C` be right;  and let it be again required to describe on `AB` a segment of a circle admitting an angle equal to the right angle at `C`.
Let the angle `BAD` be constructed equal to the right angle at `C`, as is the case in the second figure; let `AB` be bisected at `F`, and with centre `F` and distance either `FA` or `FB` let the circle `AEB` be described.
Therefore the straight line `AD` touches the circle `ABE`, because the angle at `A` is right. [elem.3.16.p.1]
And the angle `BAD` is equal to the angle in the segment `AEB`, for the latter too is itself a right angle, being an angle in a semicircle. [elem.3.31]
But the angle `BAD` is also equal to the angle at `C`.
Therefore the angle `AEB` is also equal to the angle at `C`.
Therefore again the segment `AEB` of a circle has been described on `AB` admitting an angle equal to the angle at `C`.
Next, let the angle at `C` be obtuse;  and on the straight line `AB`, and at the point `A`, let the angle `BAD` be constructed equal to it, as is the case in the third figure; let `AE` be drawn at right angles to `AD`, let `AB` be again bisected at `F`, let `FG` be drawn at right angles to `AB`, and let `GB` be joined.
Then, since `AF` is again equal to `FB`, and `FG` is common, > the two sides `AF`, `FG` are equal to the two sides `BF`, `FG`; and the angle `AFG` is equal to the angle `BFG`; > therefore the base `AG` is equal to the base `BG`. [elem.1.4]
Therefore the circle described with centre `G` and distance `GA` will pass through `B` also; let it so pass, as `AEB`.
Now, since `AD` is drawn at right angles to the diameter `AE` from its extremity, > `AD` touches the circle `AEB`. [elem.3.16.p.1]
And `AB` has been drawn across from the point of contact at `A`; > therefore the angle `BAD` is equal to the angle constructed in the alternate segment `AHB` of the circle. [elem.3.32]
But the angle `BAD` is equal to the angle at `C`.
Therefore the angle in the segment `AHB` is also equal to the angle at `C`.
Therefore on the given straight line `AB` the segment `AHB` of a circle has been described admitting an angle equal to the angle at `C`. Q. E. F.
