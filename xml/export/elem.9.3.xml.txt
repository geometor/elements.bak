Enunciation:
> If a cube number by multiplying itself make some number, the product will be cube.

Proof:
For let the cube number > A by multiplying itself make > B; I say that > B is cube.
For let > C, the side of > A, be taken, and let > C by multiplying itself make > D.
It is then manifest that > C by multiplying > D has made > A.
Now, since > C by multiplying itself has made > D, therefore > C measures > D according to the units in itself.
But further the unit also measures > C according to the units in it; therefore, as the unit is to > C, so is > C to > D. [elem.7.def.20]
Again, since > C by multiplying > D has made > A, therefore > D measures > A according to the units in > C.
But the unit also measures > C according to the units in it; therefore, as the unit is to > C, so is > D to > A.
But, as the unit is to > C, so is > C to > D; therefore also, as the unit is to > C, so is > C to > D, and > D to > A.
Therefore between the unit and the number > A two mean proportional numbers > C, > D have fallen in continued proportion.
Again, since > A by multiplying itself has made > B, therefore > A measures > B according to the units in itself.
But the unit also measures > A according to the units in it; therefore, as the unit is to > A, so is > A to > B. [elem.7.def.20]
But between the unit and > A two mean proportional numbers have fallen; therefore two mean proportional numbers will also fall between > A, > B. [elem.8.8]
But, if two mean proportional numbers fall between two numbers, and the first be cube, the second will also be cube. [elem.8.23]
And > A is cube; therefore > B is also cube. Q. E. D.
