Proof:
Let there be as many numbers as we please, , , , , , , beginning from an unit and in continued proportion, and let , the number after the unit, not be square; I say that neither will any other be square except the third from the unit <and those which leave out one>.
For, if possible, let  be square.
But  is also square; [elem.9.8] [therefore ,  have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number].
And, as  is to , so is  to ; therefore ,  have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number; [so that ,  are similar plane numbers]. [elem.8.26, converse]
And  is square; therefore  is also square: which is contrary to the hypothesis.
Therefore  is not square.
Similarly we can prove that neither is any other of the numbers square except the third from the unit and those which leave out one.
Next, let  not be cube.
I say that neither will any other be cube except the fourth from the unit and those which leave out two.
For, if possible, let  be cube.
Now  is also cube; for it is fourth from the unit. [elem.9.8]
And, as  is to , so is  to ; therefore  also has to  the ratio which a cube has to a cube.
And  is cube; therefore  is also cube. [elem.8.25]
And since, as the unit is to , so is  to , and the unit measures  according to the units in it, therefore  also measures  according to the units in itself; therefore  by multiplying itself has made the cube number .
But, if a number by multiplying itself make a cube number, it is also itself cube. [elem.9.6]
Therefore  is also cube: which is contrary to the hypothesis.
Therefore  is not cube.
Similarly we can prove that neither is any other of the numbers cube except the fourth from the unit and those which leave out two. Q. E. D.
