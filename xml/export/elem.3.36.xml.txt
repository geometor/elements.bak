Enunciation:
`If a point be taken outside a circle and from it there fall on the circle two straight lines`, `and if one of them cut the circle and the other touch it`, `the rectangle contained by the whole of the straight line which cuts the circle and the straight `.

Proof:
For let a point `D` be taken outside the circle `ABC`, and from `D` let the two straight lines `DCA`, `DB` fall on the circle `ABC`; let `DCA` cut the circle `ABC` and let `BD` touch it; I say that the rectangle contained by `AD`, `DC` is equal to the square on `DB`.
Then `DCA` is either through the centre or not through the centre.
First let it be through the centre, and let `F` be the centre of the circle `ABC`; let `FB` be joined; > therefore the angle `FBD` is right. [elem.3.18]
And, since `AC` has been bisected at `F`, and `CD` is added to it, the rectangle `AD`, `DC` together with the square on `FC` is equal to the square on `FD`. [elem.2.6]
But `FC` is equal to `FB`; therefore the rectangle `AD`, `DC` together with the square on `FB` is equal to the square on `FD`.
And the squares on `FB`, `BD` are equal to the square on `FD`; [elem.1.47] therefore the rectangle `AD`, `DC` together with the square on `FB` is equal to the squares on `FB`, `BD`.
Let the square on `FB` be subtracted from each; therefore the rectangle `AD`, `DC` which remains is equal to the square on the tangent `DB`.
Again, let `DCA` not be through the centre of the circle `ABC`; let the centre `E` be taken, and from `E` let `EF` be drawn perpendicular to `AC`; let `EB`, `EC`, `ED` be joined.
Then the angle `EBD` is right. [elem.3.18]
And, since a straight line `EF` through the centre cuts a straight line `AC` not through the centre at right angles, > it also bisects it; [elem.3.3] therefore `AF` is equal to `FC`.
Now, since the straight line `AC` has been bisected at the point `F`, and `CD` is added to it, the rectangle contained by `AD`, `DC` together with the square on `FC` is equal to the square on `FD`. [elem.2.6]
Let the square on `FE` be added to each; therefore the rectangle `AD`, `DC` together with the squares on `CF`, `FE` is equal to the squares on `FD`, `FE`.
But the square on `EC` is equal to the squares on `CF`, `FE`, for the angle `EFC` is right; [elem.1.47] and the square on `ED` is equal to the squares on `DF`, `FE`; therefore the rectangle `AD`, `DC` together with the square on `EC` is equal to the square on `ED`.
And `EC` is equal to `EB`; therefore the rectangle `AD`, `DC` together with the square on `EB` is equal to the square on `ED`.
But the squares on `EB`, `BD` are equal to the square on `ED`, for the angle `EBD` is right; [elem.1.47] therefore the rectangle `AD`, `DC` together with the square on `EB` is equal to the squares on `EB`, `BD`.
Let the square on `EB` be subtracted from each; therefore the rectangle `AD`, `DC` which remains is equal to the square on `DB`.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
