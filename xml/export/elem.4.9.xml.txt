`About a given square to circumscribe a circle`.

Proof:
Let `ABCD` be the given square; thus it is required to circumscribe a circle about the square `ABCD`.
For let `AC`, `BD` be joined, and let them cut one another at `E`.
Then, since `DA` is equal to `AB`, and `AC` is common, therefore the two sides `DA`, `AC` are equal to the two sides `BA`, `AC`; and the base `DC` is equal to the base `BC`;
Therefore the angle `DAB` is bisected by `AC`.
Similarly we can prove that each of the angles `ABC`, `BCD`, `CDA` is bisected by the straight lines `AC`, `DB`.
Now, since the angle `DAB` is equal to the angle `ABC`, and the angle `EAB` is half the angle `DAB`, and the angle `EBA` half the angle `ABC`, therefore the angle `EAB` is also equal to the angle `EBA`; so that the side `EA` is also equal to `EB`. [elem.1.6]
Similarly we can prove that each of the straight lines `EA`, `EB` is equal to each of the straight lines `EC`, `ED`.
Therefore the four straight lines `EA`, `EB`, `EC`, `ED` are equal to one another.
Therefore the circle described with centre `E` and distance one of the straight lines `EA`, `EB`, `EC`, `ED` will pass also through the remaining points; and it will have been circumscribed about the square `ABCD`.
Let it be circumscribed, as `ABCD`.
Therefore about the given square a circle has been circumscribed. Q. E. F.
