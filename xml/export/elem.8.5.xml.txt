Enunciation:
> Plane numbers have to one another the ratio compounded of the ratios of their sides.

Proof:
Let > A, > B be plane numbers, and let the numbers > C, > D be the sides of > A, and > E, > F of > B; I say that > A has to > B the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides.
For, the ratios being given which > C has to > E and > D to > F, let the least numbers > G, > H, > K that are continuously in the ratios > C : > E, > D : > F be taken, so that, > as > C is to > E, so is > G to > H, and, as > D is to > F, so is > H to > K. [elem.8.4]
And let > D by multiplying > E make > L.
Now, since > D by multiplying > C has made > A, and by multiplying > E has made > L, therefore, as > C is to > E, so is > A to > L. [elem.7.17]
But, as > C is to > E, so is > G to > H; therefore also, as > G is to > H, so is > A to > L.
Again, since > E by multiplying > D has made > L, and further by multiplying > F has made > B, therefore, as > D is to > F, so is > L to > B. [elem.7.17]
But, as > D is to > F, so is > H to > K; therefore also, as > H is to > K, so is > L to > B.
But it was also proved that, > as > G is to > H, so is > A to > L; therefore, , > as > G is to > K, so is > A to > B. [elem.7.14]
But > G has to > K the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides; therefore > A also has to > B the ratio compounded of the ratios of the sides. Q. E. D.
