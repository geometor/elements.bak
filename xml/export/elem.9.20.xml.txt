Proof:
Let , ,  be the assigned prime numbers; I say that there are more prime numbers than , , .
For let the least number measured by , ,  be taken, and let it be ; let the unit  be added to .
Then  is either prime or not.
First, let it be prime; then the prime numbers , , ,  have been found which are more than , , .
Next, let  not be prime; therefore it is measured by some prime number. [elem.7.31]
Let it be measured by the prime number .
I say that  is not the same with any of the numbers , , .
For, if possible, let it be so.
Now , ,  measure ; therefore  also will measure .
But it also measures .
Therefore , being a number, will measure the remainder, the unit : which is absurd.
Therefore  is not the same with any one of the numbers , , .
And by hypothesis it is prime.
Therefore the prime numbers , , ,  have been found which are more than the assigned multitude of , , . Q. E. D.
