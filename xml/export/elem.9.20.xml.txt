Enunciation:
> Prime numbers are more than any assigned multitude of prime numbers.

Proof:
Let > A, > B, > C be the assigned prime numbers; I say that there are more prime numbers than > A, > B, > C.
For let the least number measured by > A, > B, > C be taken, and let it be > DE; let the unit > DF be added to > DE.
Then > EF is either prime or not.
First, let it be prime; then the prime numbers > A, > B, > C, > EF have been found which are more than > A, > B, > C.
Next, let > EF not be prime; therefore it is measured by some prime number. [elem.7.31]
Let it be measured by the prime number > G.
I say that > G is not the same with any of the numbers > A, > B, > C.
For, if possible, let it be so.
Now > A, > B, > C measure > DE; therefore > G also will measure > DE.
But it also measures > EF.
Therefore > G, being a number, will measure the remainder, the unit > DF: which is absurd.
Therefore > G is not the same with any one of the numbers > A, > B, > C.
And by hypothesis it is prime.
Therefore the prime numbers > A, > B, > C, > G have been found which are more than the assigned multitude of > A, > B, > C. Q. E. D.
