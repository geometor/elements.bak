Enunciation:
A binomial straight line is divided into its terms at one point only.

Proof:
Let > AB be a binomial straight line divided into its terms at > C; therefore > AC, > CB are rational straight lines commensurable in square only. [elem.10.36
]
I say that > AB is not divided at another point into two rational straight lines commensurable in square only.
For, if possible, let it be divided at > D also, so that > AD, > DB are also rational straight lines commensurable in square only.
It is then manifest that > AC is not the same with > DB.
For, if possible, let it be so.
Then > AD will also be the same as > CB, and, as > AC is to > CB, so will > BD be to > DA; thus > AB will be divided at > D also in the same way as by the division at > C: which is contrary to the hypothesis.
Therefore > AC is not the same with > DB.
For this reason also the points > C, > D are not equidistant from the point of bisection.
Therefore that by which the squares on > AC, > CB differ from the squares on > AD, > DB is also that by which twice the rectangle > AD, > DB differs from twice the rectangle > AC, > CB, because both the squares on > AC, > CB together with twice the rectangle > AC, > CB, and the squares on > AD, > DB together with twice the rectangle > AD, > DB, are equal to the square on > AB. [elem.2.4
]
But the squares on > AC, > CB differ from the squares on > AD, > DB by a rational area, for both are rational; therefore twice the rectangle > AD, > DB also differs from twice the rectangle > AC, > CB by a rational area, though they are medial [elem.10.21
]: which is absurd, for a medial area does not exceed a medial by a rational area. [elem.10.26
]
Therefore a binomial straight line is not divided at different points; therefore it is divided at one point only. Q. E. D.
