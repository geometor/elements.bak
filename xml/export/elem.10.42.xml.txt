A binomial straight line is divided into its terms at one point only.

Proof:
Let  be a binomial straight line divided into its terms at ; therefore ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only. [elem.10.36
]
I say that  is not divided at another point into two rational straight lines commensurable in square only.
For, if possible, let it be divided at  also, so that ,  are also rational straight lines commensurable in square only.
It is then manifest that  is not the same with .
For, if possible, let it be so.
Then  will also be the same as , and, as  is to , so will  be to ; thus  will be divided at  also in the same way as by the division at : which is contrary to the hypothesis.
Therefore  is not the same with .
For this reason also the points ,  are not equidistant from the point of bisection.
Therefore that by which the squares on ,  differ from the squares on ,  is also that by which twice the rectangle ,  differs from twice the rectangle , , because both the squares on ,  together with twice the rectangle , , and the squares on ,  together with twice the rectangle , , are equal to the square on . [elem.2.4
]
But the squares on ,  differ from the squares on ,  by a rational area, for both are rational; therefore twice the rectangle ,  also differs from twice the rectangle ,  by a rational area, though they are medial [elem.10.21
]: which is absurd, for a medial area does not exceed a medial by a rational area. [elem.10.26
]
Therefore a binomial straight line is not divided at different points; therefore it is divided at one point only. Q. E. D.
