`Given a segment of a circle`, `to describe the complete circle of which it is a segment`.

Proof:
Let `ABC` be the given segment of a circle; thus it is required to describe the complete circle belonging to the segment `ABC`, that is, of which it is a segment.
For let `AC` be bisected at `D`, let `DB` be drawn from the point `D` at right angles to `AC`, and let `AB`. be joined; > the angle `ABD` is then greater than, equal to, or less than the angle `BAD`.
First let it be greater; and on the straight line `BA`, and at the point `A` on it, let the angle `BAE` be constructed equal to the angle `ABD`; let `DB` be drawn through to `E`, and let `EC` be joined.
Then, since the angle `ABE` is equal to the angle `BAE`, 
       > the straight line `EB` is also equal to `EA`. [elem.1.6]
And, since `AD` is equal to `DC`, and `DE` is common, > the two sides `AD`, `DE` are equal to the two sides `CD`, `DE` respectively; and the angle `ADE` is equal to the angle `CDE`, for each is right; > therefore the base `AE` is equal to the base `CE`.
But `AE` was proved equal to `BE`; > therefore `BE` is also equal to `CE`; therefore the three straight lines `AE`, `EB`, `EC` are equal to one another.
Therefore the circle drawn with centre `E` and distance one of the straight lines `AE`, `EB`, `EC` will also pass through the remaining points and will have been completed. [elem.3.9]
Therefore, given a segment of a circle, the complete circle has been described.
And it is manifest that the segment `ABC` is less than a semicircle, because the centre `E` happens to be outside it.
Similarly, even if the angle `ABD` be equal to the angle `BAD`, `AD` being equal to each of the two `BD`, `DC`, > the three straight lines `DA`, `DB`, `DC` will be equal to one another, 
        `D` will be the centre of the completed circle, and `ABC` will clearly be a semicircle.
But, if the angle `ABD` be less than the angle `BAD`, and if we construct, on the straight line `BA` and at the point `A` on it, an angle equal to the angle `ABD`, the centre will fall on `DB` within the segment `ABC`, and the segment 
       `ABC` will clearly be greater than a semicircle.
Therefore, given a segment of a circle, the complete circle has been described. Q. E. F.
