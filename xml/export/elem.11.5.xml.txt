Proof:
For let a straight line > AB be set up at right angles to the three straight lines > BC, > BD, > BE, at their point of meeting at > B; I say that > BC, > BD, > BE are in one plane.
For suppose they are not, but, if possible, let > BD, > BE be in the plane of reference and > BC in one more elevated; let the plane through > AB, > BC be produced; it will thus make, as common section in the plane of reference, a straight line. [elem.11.3]
Let it make > BF.
Therefore the three straight lines > AB, > BC, > BF are in one plane, namely that drawn through > AB, > BC.
Now, since > AB is at right angles to each of the straight lines > BD, > BE, therefore > AB is also at right angles to the plane through > BD, > BE. [elem.11.4]
But the plane through > BD, > BE is the plane of reference; therefore > AB is at right angles to the plane of reference.
Thus > AB will also make right angles with all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane of reference. [elem.11.def.3]
But > BF which is in the plane of reference meets it; therefore the angle > ABF is right.
But, by hypothesis, the angle > ABC is also right; therefore the angle > ABF is equal to the angle > ABC.
And they are in one plane: which is impossible.
Therefore the straight line > BC is not in a more elevated plane; therefore the three straight lines > BC, > BD, > BE are in one plane.
Therefore, if a straight line be set up at right angles to three straight lines, at their point of meeting, the three straight lines are in one plane. Q. E. D.
