Enunciation:
`If there be any number of magnitudes whatever which are`, `respectively`, `equimultiples of any magnitudes equal in multitude`, `then`, `whatever multiple one of the magnitudes is of one`, `that multiple also will all be of all`.

Proof:
Let any number of magnitudes whatever `AB`, `CD` be respectively equimultiples of any magnitudes `E`, `F` equal in multitude; I say that, whatever multiple `AB` is of `E`, that multiple will `AB`, `CD` also be of `E`, `F`.
For, since `AB` is the same multiple of `E` that `CD` is of `F`, as many magnitudes as there are in `AB` equal to `E`, so many also are there in `CD` equal to `F`.
Let `AB` be divided into the magnitudes `AG`, `GB` equal to `E`, and `CD` into `CH`, `HD` equal to `F`; then the multitude of the magnitudes `AG`, `GB` will be equal to the multitude of the magnitudes `CH`, `HD`.
Now, since `AG` is equal to `E`, and `CH` to `F`, therefore `AG` is equal to `E`, and `AG`, `CH` to `E`, `F`.
For the same reason
`GB` is equal to `E`, and `GB`, `HD` to `E`, `F`; therefore, as many magnitudes as there are in `AB` equal to `E`, so many also are there in `AB`, `CD` equal to `E`, `F`; `AB` is of `E`, that multiple will `AB`, `CD` also be of `E`, `F`.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
