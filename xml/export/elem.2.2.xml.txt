Enunciation:
`If a straight line be cut at random`, `the rectangle contained by the whole and both of the segments is equal to the square on the whole`.

Proof:
For let the straight line `AB` be cut at random at the point `C`; I say that the rectangle contained by `AB`, `BC` together with the rectangle contained by `BA`, `AC` is equal to the square on `AB`.
For let the square `ADEB` be described on `AB` [elem.1.46], and let `CF` be drawn through `C` parallel to either `AD` or `BE`. [elem.1.31]
Then `AE` is equal to `AF`, `CE`.
Now `AE` is the square on `AB`;
`AF` is the rectangle contained by `BA`, `AC`, for it is contained by `DA`, `AC`, and `AD` is equal to `AB`; > and `CE` is the rectangle `AB`, `BC`, for `BE` is equal to `AB`.
Therefore the rectangle `BA`, `AC` together with the rectangle `AB`, `BC` is equal to the square on `AB`.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
