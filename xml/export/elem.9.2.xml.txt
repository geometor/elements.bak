Proof:
Let ,  be two numbers, and let  by multiplying  make the square number ; I say that ,  are similar plane numbers.
For let  by multiplying itself make ; therefore  is square.
Now, since  by multiplying itself has made , and by multiplying  has made , therefore, as  is to , so is  to . [elem.7.17]
And, since  is square, and  is so also, therefore ,  are similar plane numbers.
Therefore one mean proportional number falls between , . [elem.8.18]
And, as  is to , so is  to ; therefore one mean proportional number falls between ,  also. [elem.8.18]
But, if one mean proportional number fall between two numbers, they are similar plane numbers; [elem.8.20] therefore ,  are similar plane numbers. Q. E. D.
