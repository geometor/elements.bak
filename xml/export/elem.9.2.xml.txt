> If two numbers by multiplying one another make a square number, they are similar plane numbers.

Proof:
Let > A, > B be two numbers, and let > A by multiplying > B make the square number > C; I say that > A, > B are similar plane numbers.
For let > A by multiplying itself make > D; therefore > D is square.
Now, since > A by multiplying itself has made > D, and by multiplying > B has made > C, therefore, as > A is to > B, so is > D to > C. [elem.7.17]
And, since > D is square, and > C is so also, therefore > D, > C are similar plane numbers.
Therefore one mean proportional number falls between > D, > C. [elem.8.18]
And, as > D is to > C, so is > A to > B; therefore one mean proportional number falls between > A, > B also. [elem.8.18]
But, if one mean proportional number fall between two numbers, they are similar plane numbers; [elem.8.20] therefore > A, > B are similar plane numbers. Q. E. D.
