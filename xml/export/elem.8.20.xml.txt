Enunciation:
> If one mean proportional number fall between two numbers, the numbers will be similar plane numbers.

Proof:
For let one mean proportional number > C fall between the two numbers > A, > B; I say that > A, > B are similar plane numbers.
Let > D, > E, the least numbers of those which have the same ratio with > A, > C, be taken; [elem.7.33] therefore > D measures > A the same number of times that > E measures > C. [elem.7.20]
Now, as many times as > D measures > A, so many units let there be in > F; therefore > F by multiplying > D has made > A, so that > A is plane, and > D, > F are its sides.
Again, since > D, > E are the least of the numbers which have the same ratio with > C, > B, therefore > D measures > C the same number of times that > E measures > B. [elem.7.20]
As many times, then, as > E measures > B, so many units let there be in > G; therefore > E measures > B according to the units in > G; therefore > G by multiplying > E has made > B.
Therefore > B is plane, and > E, > G are its sides.
Therefore > A, > B are plane numbers.
I say next that they are also similar.
For, <*> since > F by multiplying > D has made > A, and by multiplying > E has made > C, therefore, as > D is to > E, so is > A to > C, that is, > C to > B. [elem.7.17]
Again, <*> since > E by multiplying > F, > G has made > C, > B respectively, therefore, as > F is to > G, so is > C to > B. [elem.7.17]
But, as > C is to > B, so is > D to > E; therefore also, as > D is to > E, so is > F to > G.
And alternately, as > D is to > F, so is > E to > G. [elem.7.13]
Therefore > A, > B are similar plane numbers; for their sides are proportional. Q. E. D.
