Enunciation:
> To set up a straight line at right angles to a given plane from a given point in it.

Proof:
Let the plane of reference be the given plane, and > A the point in it; thus it is required to set up from the point > A a straight line at right angles to the plane of reference.
Let any elevated point > B be conceived, from > B let > BC be drawn perpendicular to the plane of reference, [elem.11.11] and through the point > A let > AD be drawn parallel to > BC. [elem.1.31]
Then, since > AD, > CB are two parallel straight lines, while one of them, > BC, is at right angles to the plane of reference, therefore the remaining one, > AD, is also at right angles to the plane of reference. [elem.11.8]
Therefore > AD has been set up at right angles to the given plane from the point > A in it.
