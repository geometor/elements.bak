Proof:
For let the two planes ,  cut one another, and let the line  be their common section; I say that the line  is a straight line.
For, if not, from  to  let the straight line  be joined in the plane , and in the plane  the straight line .
Then the two straight lines ,  will have the same extremities, and will clearly enclose an area: which is absurd.
Therefore ,  are not straight lines.
Similarly we can prove that neither will there be any other straight line joined from  to  except  the common section of the planes , .
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
