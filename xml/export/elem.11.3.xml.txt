Enunciation:
> If two planes cut one another, > their common section is a straight line.

Proof:
For let the two planes > AB, > BC cut one another, and let the line > DB be their common section; I say that the line > DB is a straight line.
For, if not, from > D to > B let the straight line > DEB be joined in the plane > AB, and in the plane > BC the straight line > DFB.
Then the two straight lines > DEB, > DFB will have the same extremities, and will clearly enclose an area: which is absurd.
Therefore > DEB, > DFB are not straight lines.
Similarly we can prove that neither will there be any other straight line joined from > D to > B except > DB the common section of the planes > AB, > BC.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
