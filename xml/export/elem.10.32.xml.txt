Enunciation:
> To find two medial straight lines commensurable in square only, containing a medial rectangle, and such that the square on the greater is greater than the square on the less by the square on a straight line commensurable with the greater.

Proof:
Let there be set out three rational straight lines > A, > B, > C commensurable in square only, and such that the square on > A is greater than the square on > C by the square on a straight line commensurable with > A, [elem.10.29] and let the square on > D be equal to the rectangle > A, > B.
Therefore the square on > D is medial; therefore > D is also medial. [elem.10.21]
Let the rectangle > D, > E be equal to the rectangle > B, > C.
Then since, as the rectangle > A, > B is to the rectangle > B, > C, so is > A to > C; while the square on > D is equal to the rectangle > A, > B, and the rectangle > D, > E is equal to the rectangle > B, > C, therefore, as > A is to > C, so is the square on > D to the rectangle > D, > E.
But, as the square on > D is to the rectangle > D, > E, so is > D to > E; therefore also, as > A is to > C, so is > D to > E.
But > A is commensurable with > C in square only; therefore > D is also commensurable with > E in square only. [elem.10.11]
But > D is medial; therefore > E is also medial. [elem.10.23, addition]
And, since, as > A is to > C, so is > D to > E, while the square on > A is greater than the square on > C by the square on a straight line commensurable with > A, therefore also the square on > D will be greater than the square on > E by the square on a straight line commensurable with > D.[elem.10.14]
I say next that the rectangle > D, > E is also medial.
For, since the rectangle > B, > C is equal to the rectangle > D, > E, while the rectangle > B, > C is medial, [elem.10.21] therefore the rectangle > D, > E is also medial.
Therefore two medial straight lines > D, > E, commensurable in square only, and containing a medial rectangle, have been found such that the square on the greater is greater than the square on the less by the square on a straight line commensurable with the greater.
