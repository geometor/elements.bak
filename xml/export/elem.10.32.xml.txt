Proof:
Let there be set out three rational straight lines , ,  commensurable in square only, and such that the square on  is greater than the square on  by the square on a straight line commensurable with , [elem.10.29] and let the square on  be equal to the rectangle , .
Therefore the square on  is medial; therefore  is also medial. [elem.10.21]
Let the rectangle ,  be equal to the rectangle , .
Then since, as the rectangle ,  is to the rectangle , , so is  to ; while the square on  is equal to the rectangle , , and the rectangle ,  is equal to the rectangle , , therefore, as  is to , so is the square on  to the rectangle , .
But, as the square on  is to the rectangle , , so is  to ; therefore also, as  is to , so is  to .
But  is commensurable with  in square only; therefore  is also commensurable with  in square only. [elem.10.11]
But  is medial; therefore  is also medial. [elem.10.23, addition]
And, since, as  is to , so is  to , while the square on  is greater than the square on  by the square on a straight line commensurable with , therefore also the square on  will be greater than the square on  by the square on a straight line commensurable with .[elem.10.14]
I say next that the rectangle ,  is also medial.
For, since the rectangle ,  is equal to the rectangle , , while the rectangle ,  is medial, [elem.10.21] therefore the rectangle ,  is also medial.
Therefore two medial straight lines , , commensurable in square only, and containing a medial rectangle, have been found such that the square on the greater is greater than the
