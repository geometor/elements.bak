Proof:
For let the two straight lines > AB, > BC meeting one another be parallel to the two straight lines > DE, > EF meeting one another, not being in the same plane; I say that the planes produced through > AB, > BC and > DE, > EF will not meet one another.
For let > BG be drawn from the point > B perpendicular to the plane through > DE, > EF [elem.11.11], and let it meet the plane at the point > G; through > G let > GH be drawn parallel to > ED, and > GK parallel to > EF. [elem.1.31]
Now, since > BG is at right angles to the plane through > DE, > EF, therefore it will also make right angles with all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane through > DE, > EF. [elem.11.def.3]
But each of the straight lines > GH, > GK meets it and is in the plane through > DE, > EF; therefore each of the angles > BGH, > BGK is right.
And, since > BA is parallel to > GH, [elem.11.9] therefore the angles > GBA, > BGH are equal to two right angles. [elem.1.29]
But the angle > BGH is right; therefore the angle > GBA is also right; therefore > GB is at right angles to > BA.
For the same reason > GB is also at right angles to > BC.
Since then the straight line > GB is set up at right angles to the two straight lines > BA, > BC which cut one another, therefore > GB is also at right angles to the plane through > BA, > BC. [elem.11.4]
But planes to which the same straight line is at right angles are parallel; [elem.11.14] therefore the plane through > AB, > BC is parallel to the plane through > DE, > EF.
Therefore, if two straight lines meeting one another be parallel to two straight lines meeting one another, not in the same plane, the planes through them are parallel. Q. E. D.
