Enunciation:
> Given three numbers not prime to one another, to find their greatest common measure.

Proof:
Let > A, > B, > C be the three given numbers not prime to one another; thus it is required to find the greatest common measure of > A, > B, > C.
For let the greatest common measure, > D, of the two numbers > A, > B be taken; [elem.7.2] then > D either measures, or does not measure, > C.
First, let it measure it.
But it measures > A, > B also; therefore > D measures > A, > B, > C; therefore > D is a common measure of > A, > B, > C.
I say that it is also the greatest.
For, if > D is not the greatest common measure of > A, > B, > C, some number which is greater than > D will measure the numbers > A, > B, > C.
Let such a number measure them, and let it be > E.
Since then > E measures > A, > B, > C, it will also measure > A, > B; therefore it will also measure the greatest common measure of > A, > B. [elem.7.2.p.1]
But the greatest common measure of > A, > B is > D; therefore > E measures > D, the greater the less: which is impossible.
Therefore no number which is greater than > D will measure the numbers > A, > B, > C; > therefore > D is the greatest common measure of > A, > B, > C.
Next, let > D not measure > C; I say first that > C, > D are not prime to one another.
For, since > A, > B, > C are not prime to one another, some number will measure them.
Now that which measures > A, > B, > C will also measure > A, > B, and will measure > D, the greatest common measure of > A, > B. [elem.7.2.p.1]
But it measures > C also; therefore some number will measure the numbers > D, > C; therefore > D, > C are not prime to one another.
Let then their greatest common measure > E be taken. [elem.7.2]
Then, since > E measures > D, and > D measures > A, > B, therefore > E also measures > A, > B.
But it measures > C also; therefore > E measures > A, > B, > C; therefore > E is a common measure of > A, > B, > C.
I say next that it is also the greatest.
For, if > E is not the greatest common measure of > A, > B, > C, some number which is greater than > E will measure the numbers > A, > B, > C.
Let such a number measure them, and let it be > F.
Now, since > F measures > A, > B, > C, it also measures > A, > B; therefore it will also measure the greatest common measure of > A, > B. [elem.7.2.p.1]
But the greatest common measure of > A, > B is > D; therefore > F measures > D.
And it measures > C also; therefore > F measures > D, > C; therefore it will also measure the greatest common measure of > D, > C. [elem.7.2.p.1]
But the greatest common measure of > D, > C is > E; therefore > F measures > E, the greater the less: which is impossible.
Therefore no number which is greater than > E will measure the numbers > A, > B, > C; therefore > E is the greatest common measure of > A, > B, > C. Q. E. D.
