Enunciation:
If on one of the sides of a triangle, from its extremities, there be constructed two straight lines meeting within the triangle, the straight lines so constructed will be less than the remaining two sides of the triangle, but will contain a greater

Proof:
On `BC`, one of the sides of the triangle `ABC`, from its extremities `B`, `C`, let the two straight lines `BD`, `DC` be constructed meeting within the triangle;
I say that `BD`, `DC` are less than the remaining two sides `BA`, `AC`, but contain an angle `BDC` greater than the angle `BAC`.
For let `BD` be drawn through to `E`.
Then, since in any triangle two sides are greater than the remaining elem.1.20]
Let `EC` be added to each;
Again, since, in the triangle `CED`,
But `BA`, `AC` were proved greater than `BE`, `EC`;
Again, since in any triangle the exterior angle is greater than the interior and opposite angle, [elem.1.16] therefore, in the triangle `CDE`,
For the same reason, moreover, in the triangle `ABE` also,  But the angle `BDC` was proved greater than the angle `CEB`;
Therefore etc.
