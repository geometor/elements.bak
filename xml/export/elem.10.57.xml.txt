Proof:
For let the area  be contained by the rational straight line  and the fourth binomial  divided into its terms at , of which terms let  be the greater; I say that the 
 of the area  is the irrational straight line called major.
For, since  is a fourth binomial straight line, therefore ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, the square on  is greater than the square on  by the square on a straight line incommensurable with , and  is commensurable in length with . [elem.10.def.2.4]
Let  be bisected at , and let there be applied to  a parallelogram, the rectangle , , equal to the square on ; therefore  is incommensurable in length with . [elem.10.18]
Let , ,  be drawn parallel to , and let the rest of the construction be as before; it is then manifest that  is the 
 of the area .
It is next to be proved that  is the irrational straight line called major.
Since  is incommensurable with ,  is also incommensurable with , that is,  with ; [elem.6.1, elem.10.11] therefore ,  are incommensurable in square.
And, since  is commensurable with ,  is rational; [elem.10.19] and it is equal to the squares on , ; therefore the sum of the squares on ,  is also rational.
And, since  is incommensurable in length with , that is, with , while  is commensurable with , therefore  is incommensurable in length with . [elem.10.13]
Therefore ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore , that is, , is medial. [elem.10.21]
And it is contained by , ; therefore the rectangle ,  is medial.
And the [sum] of the squares on ,  is rational, and ,  are incommensurable in square.
But, if two straight lines incommensurable in square and making the sum of the squares on them rational, but the rectangle contained by them medial, be added together, the whole is irrational and is called major. [elem.10.39]
Therefore  is the irrational straight line called major and is the 
 of the area  Q. E. D.
