`In a given circle to inscribe an equilateral and equiangular pentagon`.

Proof:
Let `ABCDE` be the given circle; thus it is required to inscribe in the circle `ABCDE` an equilateral and equiangular pentagon.
Let the isosceles triangle `FGH` be set out having each of the angles at `G`, `H` double of the angle at `F`; [elem.4.10]  let there be inscribed in the circle `ABCDE` the triangle `ACD` equiangular with the triangle `FGH`, so that the angle `CAD` is equal to the angle at `F` and the angles at `G`, `H` respectively equal to the angles `ACD`, `CDA`; [elem.4.2] therefore each of the angles `ACD`, `CDA` is also double of the angle `CAD`.
Now let the angles `ACD`, `CDA` be bisected respectively by the straight lines `CE`, `DB` [elem.1.9], and let `AB`, `BC`, `DE`, `EA` be joined.
Then, since each of the angles `ACD`, `CDA` is double of the angle `CAD`, and they have been bisected by the straight lines `CE`, `DB`, therefore the five angles `DAC`, `ACE`, `ECD`, `CDB`, `BDA` are equal to one another.
But equal angles stand on equal circumferences; [elem.3.26] therefore the five circumferences `AB`, `BC`, `CD`, `DE`, `EA` are equal to one another.
But equal circumferences are subtended by equal straight lines; [elem.3.29] therefore the five straight lines `AB`, `BC`, `CD`, `DE`, `EA` are equal to one another;
I say next that it is also equiangular.
For, since the circumference `AB` is equal to the circumference `DE`, let `BCD` be added to each;
And the angle `AED` stands on the circumference `ABCD`, and the angle `BAE` on the circumference `EDCB`;
For the same reason each of the angles `ABC`, `BCD`, `CDE` is also equal to each of the angles `BAE`, `AED`;
But it was also proved equilateral;
