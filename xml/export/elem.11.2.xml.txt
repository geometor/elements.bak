Proof:
For let the two straight lines > AB, > CD cut one another at the point > E; I say that > AB, > CD are in one plane, and every triangle is in one plane.
For let points > F, > G be taken at random on > EC, > EB, let > CB, > FG be joined, and let > FH, > GK be drawn across; I say first that the triangle > ECB is in one plane.
For, if part of the triangle > ECB, either > FHC or > GBK, is in the plane of reference, and the rest in another, a part also of one of the straight lines > EC, > EB will be in the plane of reference, and a part in another.
But, if the part > FCBG of the triangle > ECB be in the plane of reference, and the rest in another, a part also of both the straight lines > EC, > EB will be in the plane of reference and a part in another: which was proved absurd. [elem.11.1]
Therefore the triangle > ECB is in one plane.
But, in whatever plane the triangle > ECB is, in that plane also is each of the straight lines > EC, > EB, and, in whatever plane each of the straight lines > EC, > EB is, in that plane are > AB, > CD also. [elem.11.1]
Therefore the straight lines > AB, > CD are in one plane, and every triangle is in one plane. Q. E. D.
