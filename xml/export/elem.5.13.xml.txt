Enunciation:
`If a first magnitude have to a second the same ratio as a third to a fourth`, `and the third have to the fourth a greater ratio than a fifth has to a sixth`, `the first will also have to the second a greater ratio than the fifth to the sixth`.

Proof:
For let a first magnitude `A` have to a second `B` the same ratio as a third `C` has to a fourth `D`, and let the third `C` have to the fourth `D` a greater ratio than a fifth `E` has to a sixth `F`; I say that the first `A` will also have to the second `B` a greater ratio than the fifth `E` to the sixth `F`.
For, since there are some equimultiples of `C`, `E`, and of `D`, `F` other, chance, equimultiples, such that the multiple of `C` is in excess of the multiple of `D`, while the multiple of `E` is not in excess of the multiple of `F`, [elem.5.def.7] let them be taken, and let `G`, `H` be equimultiples of `C`, `E`, and `K`, `L` other, chance, equimultiples of `D`, `F`, so that `G` is in excess of `K`, but `H` is not in excess of `L`; and, whatever multiple `G` is of `C`, let `M` be also that multiple of `A`, and, whatever multiple `K` is of `D`, let `N` be also that multiple of `B`.
Now, since, as `A` is to `B`, so is `C` to `D`, and of `A`, `C` equimultiples `M`, `G` have been taken, and of `B`, `D` other, chance, equimultiples `N`, `K`, therefore, if `M` is in excess of `N`, `G` is also in excess of `K`, if equal, equal, and if less, less. [elem.5.def.5]
But `G` is in excess of `K`; therefore `M` is also in excess of `N`.
But `H` is not in excess of `L`; and `M`, `H` are equimultiples of `A`, `E`, and `N`, `L` other, chance, equimultiples of `B`, `F`; > therefore `A` has to `B` a greater ratio than `E` has to `F`. [elem.5.def.7]
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
