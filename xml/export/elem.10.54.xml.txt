> If an area be contained by a rational straight line and the first binomial, the 
 of the area is the irrational straight line which is called binomial.

Proof:
For let the area > AC be contained by the rational straight line > AB and the first binomial > AD; I say that the 
 of the area > AC is the irrational straight line which is called binomial.
For, since > AD is a first binomial straight line, let it be divided into its terms at > E, and let > AE be the greater term.
It is then manifest that > AE, > ED are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, the square on > AE is greater than the square on > ED by the square on a straight line commensurable with > AE, and > AE is commensurable in length with the rational straight line > AB set out. [elem.10.def.2.1]
Let > ED be bisected at the point > F.
Then, since the square on > AE is greater than the square on > ED by the square on a straight line commensurable with > AE, therefore, if there be applied to the greater > AE a parallelogram equal to the fourth part of the square on the less, that is, to the square on > EF, and deficient by a square figure, it divides it into commensurable parts. [elem.10.17]
Let then the rectangle > AG, > GE equal to the square on > EF be applied to > AE; therefore > AG is commensurable in length with > EG.
Let > GH, > EK, > FL be drawn from > G, > E, > F parallel to either of the straight lines > AB, > CD; let the square > SN be constructed equal to the parallelogram > AH, and the square > NQ equal to > GK, [elem.2.14] and let them be placed so that > MN is in a straight line with > NO; therefore > RN is also in a straight line with > NP.
And let the parallelogram > SQ be completed; therefore > SQ is a square. [Lemma]
Now, since the rectangle > AG, > GE is equal to the square on > EF, therefore, as > AG is to > EF, so is > FE to > EG; [elem.6.17] therefore also, as > AH is to > EL, so is > EL to > KG; [elem.6.1] therefore > EL is a mean proportional between > AH, > GK.
But > AH is equal to > SN, and > GK to > NQ; therefore > EL is a mean proportional between > SN, > NQ.
But > MR is also a mean proportional between the same > SN, > NQ; [Lemma] therefore > EL is equal to > MR, so that it is also equal to > PO.
But > AH, > GK are also equal to > SN, > NQ; therefore the whole > AC is equal to the whole > SQ, that is, to the square on > MO; therefore > MO is the 
 of > AC.
I say next that > MO is binomial.
For, since > AG is commensurable with > GE, therefore > AE is also commensurable with each of the straight lines > AG, > GE. [elem.10.15]
But > AE is also, by hypothesis, commensurable with > AB; therefore > AG, > GE are also commensurable with > AB. [elem.10.12]
And > AB is rational; therefore each of the straight lines > AG, > GE is also rational; therefore each of the rectangles > AH, > GK is rational, [elem.10.19] and > AH is commensurable with > GK.
But > AH is equal to > SN, and > GK to > NQ; therefore > SN, > NQ, that is, the squares on > MN, > NO, are rational and commensurable.
And, since > AE is incommensurable in length with > ED, while > AE is commensurable with > AG, and > DE is commensurable with > EF, therefore > AG is also incommensurable with > EF, [elem.10.13] so that > AH is also incommensurable with > EL. [elem.6.1, elem.10.11]
But > AH is equal to > SN, and > EL to > MR; therefore > SN is also incommensurable with > MR.
But, as > SN is to > MR, so is > PN to > NR; [elem.6.1] therefore > PN is incommensurable with > NR. [elem.10.11]
But > PN is equal to > MN, and > NR to > NO; therefore > MN is incommensurable with > NO.
And the square on > MN is commensurable with the square on > NO, and each is rational; therefore > MN, > NO are rational straight lines commensurable in square only.
Therefore > MO is binomial [elem.10.36] and the 
 of > AC. Q. E. D.
