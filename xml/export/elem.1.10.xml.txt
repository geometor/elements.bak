To bisect a given finite straight line.

Proof:
Let `AB` be the given finite straight line.
Thus it is required to bisect the finite straight line `AB`.
Let the equilateral triangle `ABC` be constructed on it, [elem.1.1] and let the angle `ACB` be bisected by the straight line `CD`; [elem.1.9]
I say that the straight line `AB` has been bisected at the point `D`.
For, since `AC` is equal to `CB`, and `CD` is common, 
        > the two sides `AC`, `CD` are equal to the two sides `BC`, `CD` respectively; and the angle `ACD` is equal to the angle `BCD`; > therefore the base `AD` is equal to the base `BD`. [elem.1.4]
Therefore the given finite straight line `AB` has been bisected at `D`.
