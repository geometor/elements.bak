Proof:
Let two numbers ,  be set out such that  neither has to , nor yet to , the ratio which a square number has to a square number.
Let a rational straight line  be set out, and let  be commensurable in length with ; therefore  is also rational.
Let it be contrived that, as the number  is to , so is the square on  to the square on ; [elem.10.6.p.1] therefore the square on  is commensurable with the square on ; [elem.10.6] therefore  is also rational.
Now, since  has not to  the ratio which a square number has to a square number, neither has the square on  to the square on  the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore  is incommensurable in length with . [elem.10.9]
Therefore ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; so that  is binomial.
I say next that it is also a fourth binomial straight line.
For since, as  is to , so is the square on  to the square on , therefore the square on  is greater than the square on .
Let then the squares on ,  be equal to the square on ; , as the number  is to , so is the square on  to the square on . [elem.5.19.p.1]
But  has not to  the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore neither has the square on  to the square on  the ratio which a square number has to a square number.
Therefore  is incommensurable in length with ; [elem.10.9] therefore the square on  is greater than the square on  by the square on a straight line incommensurable with .
And ,  are rational straight lines commensurable in square only, and  is commensurable in length with .
Therefore  is a fourth binomial straight line. Q. E. D.
