Enunciation:
> To find two medial straight lines commensurable in square only, containing a rational rectangle, and such that the square on the greater is greater than the square on the less by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with the greater.

Proof:
Let there be set out two rational straight lines > A, > B commensurable in square only and such that the square on > A, being the greater, is greater than the square on > B the less by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with > A. [elem.10.29]
And let the square on > C be equal to the rectangle > A, > B.
Now the rectangle > A, > B is medial; [elem.10.21] therefore the square on > C is also medial; therefore > C is also medial. [elem.10.21]
Let the rectangle > C, > D be equal to the square on > B.
Now the square on > B is rational; therefore the rectangle > C, > D is also rational.
And since, as > A is to > B, so is the rectangle > A, > B to the square on > B, while the square on > C is equal to the rectangle > A, > B, and the rectangle > C, > D is equal to the square on > B, therefore, as > A is to > B, so is the square on > C to the rectangle > C, > D.
But, as the square on > C is to the rectangle > C, > D, so is > C to > D; therefore also, as > A is to > B, so is > C to > D.
But > A is commensurable with > B in square only; therefore > C is also commensurable with > D in square only. [elem.10.11]
And > C is medial; therefore > D is also medial. [elem.10.23, addition]
And since, as > A is to > B, so is > C to > D, and the square on > A is greater than the square on > B by the square on a straight line commensurable with > A, therefore also the square on > C is greater than the square on > D by the square on a straight line commensurable with > C. [elem.10.14]
Therefore two medial straight lines > C, > D, commensurable in square only and containing a rational rectangle, have been found, and the square on > C is greater than the square on > D by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with > C.
Similarly also it can be proved that the square on > C exceeds the square on > D by the square on a straight line incommensurable with > C, when the square on > A is greater than the square on > B by the square on a straight line incommensurable with > A. [elem.10.30]
