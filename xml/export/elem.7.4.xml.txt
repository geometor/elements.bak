Proof:
Let ,  be two numbers, and let  be the less; I say that  is either a part, or parts, of .
For ,  are either prime to one another or not.
First, let ,  be prime to one another.
Then, if  be divided into the units in it, each unit of those in  will be some part of ; so that  is parts of .
Next let ,  not be prime to one another; then  either measures, or does not measure, .
If now  measures ,  is a part of .
But, if not, let the greatest common measure  of ,  be taken; [elem.7.2] and let  be divided into the numbers equal to , namely , , .
Now, since  measures ,  is a part of .
But  is equal to each of the numbers , , ; therefore each of the numbers , ,  is also a part of ; so that  is parts of .
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
