Enunciation:
> Any number is either a part or parts of any number, the less of the greater.

Proof:
Let > A, > BC be two numbers, and let > BC be the less; I say that > BC is either a part, or parts, of > A.
For > A, > BC are either prime to one another or not.
First, let > A, > BC be prime to one another.
Then, if > BC be divided into the units in it, each unit of those in > BC will be some part of > A; so that > BC is parts of > A.
Next let > A, > BC not be prime to one another; then > BC either measures, or does not measure, > A.
If now > BC measures > A, > BC is a part of > A.
But, if not, let the greatest common measure > D of > A, > BC be taken; [elem.7.2] and let > BC be divided into the numbers equal to > D, namely > BE, > EF, > FC.
Now, since > D measures > A, > D is a part of > A.
But > D is equal to each of the numbers > BE, > EF, > FC; therefore each of the numbers > BE, > EF, > FC is also a part of > A; so that > BC is parts of > A.
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
