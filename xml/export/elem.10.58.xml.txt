> If an area be contained by a rational straight line and the fifth binomial, the 
 of the area is the irrational straight line called the side of a rational plus a medial area.

Proof:
For let the area > AC be contained by the rational straight line > AB and the fifth binomial > AD divided into its terms at > E, so that > AE is the greater term; I say that the 
 of the area > AC is the irrational straight line called the side of a rational plus a medial area.
For let the same construction be made as before shown; it is then manifest that > MO is the 
 of the area > AC.
It is then to be proved that > MO is the side of a rational plus a medial area.
For, since > AG is incommensurable with > GE, [elem.10.18] therefore > AH is also commensurable with > HE, [elem.6.1, elem.10.11] that is, the square on > MN with the square on > NO; therefore > MN, > NO are incommensurable in square.
And, since > AD is a fifth binomial straight line, and > ED the lesser segment, therefore > ED is commensurable in length with > AB. [elem.10.def.2.5]
But > AE is incommensurable with > ED; therefore > AB is also incommensurable in length with > AE. [elem.10.13]
Therefore > AK, that is, the sum of the squares on > MN, > NO, is medial. [elem.10.21]
And, since > DE is commensurable in length with > AB, that is, with > EK, while > DE is commensurable with > EF, therefore > EF is also commensurable with > EK. [elem.10.12]
And > EK is rational; therefore > EL, that is, > MR, that is, the rectangle > MN, > NO, is also rational. [elem.10.19]
Therefore > MN, > NO are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them medial, but the rectangle contained by them rational.
Therefore > MO is the side of a rational plus a medial area [elem.10.40] and is the 
 of the area > AC. Q. E. D.
