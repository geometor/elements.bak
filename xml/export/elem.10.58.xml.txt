Proof:
For let the area  be contained by the rational straight line  and the fifth binomial  divided into its terms at , so that  is the greater term; I say that the 
 of the area  is the irrational straight line called the side of a rational plus a medial area.
For let the same construction be made as before shown; it is then manifest that  is the 
 of the area
It is then to be proved that  is the side of a rational plus a medial area.
For, since  is incommensurable with , [elem.10.18] therefore  is also commensurable with , [elem.6.1, elem.10.11] that is, the square on  with the square on ; therefore ,  are incommensurable in square.
And, since  is a fifth binomial straight line, and  the lesser segment, therefore  is commensurable in length with . [elem.10.def.2.5]
But  is incommensurable with ; therefore  is also incommensurable in length with  [elem.10.13]
Therefore , that is, the sum of the squares on , , is medial. [elem.10.21]
And, since  is commensurable in length with , that is, with , while  is commensurable with , therefore  is also commensurable with  [elem.10.12]
And  is rational; therefore , that is, , that is, the rectangle , , is also rational. [elem.10.19]
Therefore ,  are straight lines incommensurable in square which make the sum of the squares on them medial, but the rectangle contained by them rational.
Therefore  is the side of a rational plus a medial area [elem.10.40] and is the 
 of the area  Q. E. D.
