> The square on an apotome applied to a rational straight line produces as breadth a first apotome.

Proof:
Let > AB be an apotome, and > CD rational, and to > CD let there be applied > CE equal to the square on > AB and producing > CF as breadth; I say that > CF is a first apotome.
For let > BG be the annex to > AB; therefore > AG, > GB are rational straight lines commensurable in square only. [elem.10.73]
To > CD let there be applied > CH equal to the square on > AG, and > KL equal to the square on > BG.
Therefore the whole > CL is equal to the squares on > AG, > GB, and, in these, > CE is equal to the square on > AB; therefore the remainder > FL is equal to twice the rectangle > AG, > GB. [elem.2.7]
Let > FM be bisected at the point > N, and let > NO be drawn through > N parallel to > CD; therefore each of the rectangles > FO, > LN is equal to the rectangle > AG, > GB.
Now, since the squares on > AG, > GB are rational, and > DM is equal to the squares on > AG, > GB,. therefore > DM is rational.
And it has been applied to the rational straight line > CD, producing > CM as breadth; therefore > CM is rational and commensurable in length with > CD. [elem.10.20]
Again, since twice the rectangle > AG, > GB is medial, and > FL is equal to twice the rectangle > AG, > GB, therefore > FL is medial.
And it is applied to the rational straight line > CD, producing > FM as breadth; therefore > FM is rational and incommensurable in length with > CD. [elem.10.22]
And, since the squares on > AG, > GB are rational, while twice the rectangle > AG, > GB is medial, therefore the squares on > AG, > GB are incommensurable with twice the rectangle > AG, > GB.
And > CL is equal to the squares on > AG, > GB, and > FL to twice the rectangle > AG, > GB; therefore > DM is incommensurable with > FL.
But, as > DM is to > FL, so is > CM to > FM; [elem.6.1] therefore > CM is incommensurable in length with > FM. [elem.10.11]
And both are rational; therefore > CM, > MF are rational straight lines commensurable in square only; therefore > CF is an apotome. [elem.10.73]
I say next that it is also a first apotome.
For, since the rectangle > AG, > GB is a mean proportional between the squares on > AG, > GB, and > CH is equal to the square on > AG, > KL equal to the square on > BG, and > NL equal to the rectangle > AG, > GB, therefore > NL is also a mean proportional between > CH, > KL; therefore, as > CH is to > NL, so is > NL to > KL.
But, as > CH is to > NL, so is > CK to > NM, and, as > NL is to > KL, so is > NM to > KM; [elem.6.1] therefore the rectangle > CK, > KM is equal to the square on > NM [elem.6.17], that is, to the fourth part of the square on > FM.
And, since the square on > AG is commensurable with the square on > GB, > CH is also commensurable with > KL.
But, as > CH is to > KL, so is > CK to > KM; [elem.6.1] therefore > CK is commensurable with > KM. [elem.10.11]
Since then > CM, > MF are two unequal straight lines, and to > CM there has been applied the rectangle > CK, > KM equal to the fourth part of the square on > FM and deficient by a square figure, while > CK is commensurable with > KM, therefore the square on > CM is greater than the square on > MF by the square on a straight line commensurable in length with > CM. [elem.10.17]
And > CM is commensurable in length with the rational straight line > CD set out; therefore > CF is a first apotome. [elem.10.def.3.1]
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
