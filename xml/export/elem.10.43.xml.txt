For, if possible, let it be divided at > D also, so that > AD, > DB are also medial straight lines commensurable in square only and containing a rational rectangle.
Since, then, that by which twice the rectangle > AD, > DB differs from twice the rectangle > AC, > CB is that by which the squares on > AC, > CB differ from the squares on > AD, > DB, while twice the rectangle > AD, > DB differs from twice the rectangle > AC, > CB by a rational area—for both are rational— therefore the squares on > AC, > CB also differ from the squares on > AD, > DB by a rational area, though they are medial: which is absurd.

Therefore a first bimedial straight line is not divided into its terms at different points; therefore it is so divided at one point only.
