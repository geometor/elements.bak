Proof:
Let  be a first bimedial straight line divided at , so that ,  are medial straight lines commensurable in square only and containing a rational rectangle;  is not so divided at another point.
For, if possible, let it be divided at  also, so that ,  are also medial straight lines commensurable in square only and containing a rational rectangle.
Since, then, that by which twice the rectangle ,  differs from twice the rectangle ,  is that by which the squares on ,  differ from the squares on , , while twice the rectangle ,  differs from twice the rectangle ,  by a rational area—for both are rational— therefore the squares on ,  also differ from the squares on ,  by a rational area, though they are medial: which is absurd. [elem.10.26

Therefore a first bimedial straight line is not divided into its terms at different points; therefore it is so divided at one point only.
