Enunciation:
`In equiangular triangles the sides about the equal angles are proportional`, `and those are corresponding sides which subtend the equal angles`.

Proof:
Let `ABC`, `DCE` be equiangular triangles having the angle `ABC` equal to the angle `DCE`, the angle `BAC` to the angle `CDE`, and further the angle `ACB` to the angle `CED`; I say that in the triangles `ABC`, `DCE` the sides about the equal angles are proportional, and those are corresponding sides which subtend the equal angles.
For let `BC` be placed in a straight line with `CE`.
Then, since the angles `ABC`, `ACB` are less than two right angles, [elem.1.17] and the angle `ACB` is equal to the angle `DEC`, therefore the angles `ABC`, `DEC` are less than two right angles; therefore `BA`, `ED`, when produced, will meet. [elem.1.post.5]
Let them be produced and meet at `F`.
Now, since the angle `DCE` is equal to the angle `ABC`, > `BF` is parallel to `CD`. [elem.1.28]
Again, since the angle `ACB` is equal to the angle `DEC`, > `AC` is parallel to `FE`. [elem.1.28]
Therefore `FACD` is a parallelogram; therefore `FA` is equal to `DC`, and `AC` to `FD`. [elem.1.34]
And, since `AC` has been drawn parallel to `FE`, one side of the triangle `FBE`, therefore, as `BA` is to `AF`, so is `BC` to `CE`. [elem.6.2]
But `AF` is equal to `CD`; > therefore, as `BA` is to `CD`, so is `BC` to `CE`, and alternately, as `AB` is to `BC`, so is `DC` to `CE`. [elem.5.16]
Again, since `CD` is parallel to `BF`, therefore, as `BC` is to `CE`, so is `FD` to `DE`. [elem.6.2]
But `FD` is equal to `AC`; > therefore, as `BC` is to `CE`, so is `AC` to `DE`, and alternately, as `BC` is to `CA`, so is `CE` to `ED`. [elem.5.16]
Since then it was proved that, > as `AB` is to `BC`, so is `DC` to `CE`, and, as `BC` is to `CA`, so is `CE` to `ED`; therefore, `ex aequali`, as `BA` is to `AC`, so is `CD` to `DE`. [elem.5.22]
Therefore etc. Q. E. D.
