Proof:
Let as many numbers as we please, , , , , in continued proportion be the least of those which have the same ratio with them; ,  are prime to one another.
For let two numbers , , the least that are in the ratio of , , , , be taken, [elem.7.33] then three others , ,  with the same property; and others, more by one continually, [elem.8.2] until the multitude taken becomes equal to the multitude of the numbers , , , .
Let them be taken, and let them be , , , .
Now, since ,  are the least of those which have the same ratio with them, they are prime to one another. [elem.7.22]
And, since the numbers ,  by multiplying themselves respectively have made the numbers , , and by multiplying the numbers ,  respectively have made the numbers , , [elem.8.2.p.1] therefore both ,  and ,  are prime to one another. [elem.7.27]
And, since , , ,  are the least of those which have the same ratio with them, while , , ,  are the least that are in the same ratio with , , , , and the multitude of the numbers , , ,  is equal to the multitude of the numbers , , , , therefore the numbers , , ,  are equal to the numbers , , ,  respectively; therefore  is equal to , and  to .
And ,  are prime to one another.
Therefore ,  are also prime to one another. Q. E. D.
