Enunciation:
> If as many numbers as we please in continued proportion be the least of those which have the same ratio with them, the extremes of them are prime to one another.

Proof:
Let as many numbers as we please, > A, > B, > C, > D, in continued proportion be the least of those which have the same ratio with them; 
       I say that the extremes of them > A, > D are prime to one another.
For let two numbers > E, > F, the least that are in the ratio of > A, > B, > C, > D, be taken, [elem.7.33] then three others > G, > H, > K with the same property; and others, more by one continually, [elem.8.2] until the multitude taken becomes equal to the multitude of the numbers > A, > B, > C, > D.
Let them be taken, and let them be > L, > M, > N, > O.
Now, since > E, > F are the least of those which have the same ratio with them, they are prime to one another. [elem.7.22]
And, since the numbers > E, > F by multiplying themselves respectively have made the numbers > G, > K, and by multiplying the numbers > G, > K respectively have made the numbers > L, > O, [elem.8.2.p.1] therefore both > G, > K and > L, > O are prime to one another. [elem.7.27]
And, since > A, > B, > C, > D are the least of those which have the same ratio with them, while > L, > M, > N, > O are the least that are in the same ratio with > A, > B, > C, > D, and the multitude of the numbers > A, > B, > C, > D is equal to the multitude of the numbers > L, > M, > N, > O, therefore the numbers > A, > B, > C, > D are equal to the numbers > L, > M, > N, > O respectively; therefore > A is equal to > L, and > D to > O.
And > L, > O are prime to one another.
Therefore > A, > D are also prime to one another. Q. E. D.
