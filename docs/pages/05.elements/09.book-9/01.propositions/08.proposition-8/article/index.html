       <hi rend="ital">If as many numbers as we please beginning from an unit be in continued proportion, the third from the unit will be square, as will also those which successively leave out one; the fourth will be cube, as will also all those which leave out two; and the seventh will be at once cube and square, as will also those which leave out five.</hi>

<p>===</p>
<p>
       <span class="ital">If as many numbers as we please beginning from an unit be in continued proportion, the third from the unit will be square, as will also those which successively leave out one; the fourth will be cube, as will also all those which leave out two; and the seventh will be at once cube and square, as will also those which leave out five.</span>
      </p>
<p>Let there be as many numbers as we please, <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>, beginning from an unit and in continued proportion; I say that <span class="ital">B</span>, the third from the unit, is square, as are also all those which leave out one; <span class="ital">C</span>, the fourth, is cube, as are also all those which leave out two; and <span class="ital">F</span>, the seventh, is at once cube and square, as are also all those which leave out five. 
      </p>
<p>For since, as the unit is to <span class="ital">A</span>, so is <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>, therefore the unit measures the number <span class="ital">A</span> the same number of times that <span class="ital">A</span> measures <span class="ital">B</span>. [<a href="/elem.7.def.20">VII. Def. 20</a>] </p>
<p>But the unit measures the number <span class="ital">A</span> according to the units in it; therefore <span class="ital">A</span> also measures <span class="ital">B</span> according to the units in <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>
<p>Therefore <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying itself has made <span class="ital">B</span>; therefore <span class="ital">B</span> is square. </p>
<p>And, since <span class="ital">B</span>, <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> are in continued proportion, and <span class="ital">B</span> is square, therefore <span class="ital">D</span> is also square. [<a href="/elem.8.22">VIII. 22</a>] <pb n="391"/></p>
<p>For the same reason <span class="ital">F</span> is also square. </p>
<p>Similarly we can prove that all those which leave out one are square. </p>
<p>I say next that <span class="ital">C</span>, the fourth from the unit, is cube, as are also all those which leave out two. </p>
<p>For since, as the unit is to <span class="ital">A</span>, so is <span class="ital">B</span> to <span class="ital">C</span>, therefore the unit measures the number <span class="ital">A</span> the same number of times that <span class="ital">B</span> measures <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>
<p>But the unit measures the number <span class="ital">A</span> according to the units in <span class="ital">A</span>; therefore <span class="ital">B</span> also measures <span class="ital">C</span> according to the units in <span class="ital">A</span>. </p>
<p>Therefore <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying <span class="ital">B</span> has made <span class="ital">C</span>. </p>
<p>Since then <span class="ital">A</span> by multiplying itself has made <span class="ital">B</span>, and by multiplying <span class="ital">B</span> has made <span class="ital">C</span>, therefore <span class="ital">C</span> is cube. </p>
<p>And, since <span class="ital">C</span>, <span class="ital">D</span>, <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span> are in continued proportion, and <span class="ital">C</span> is cube, therefore <span class="ital">F</span> is also cube. [<a href="/elem.8.23">VIII. 23</a>] </p>
<p>But it was also proved square; therefore the seventh from the unit is both cube and square. </p>
<p>Similarly we can prove that all the numbers which leave out five are also both cube and square. Q. E. D.</p>
