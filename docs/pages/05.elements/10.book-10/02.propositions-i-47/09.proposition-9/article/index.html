<p>===</p>
<p><span class="ital">The squares on straight lines commensurable in length have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number; and squares which have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number will also have their sides commensurable in length</span>. <title>But the squares on straight lines incommensurable in length have not to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number; and squares which have not to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number will not have their sides commensurable in length either</title>. <pb n="29"/></p>
<p>For let <span class="ital">A</span>, <span class="ital">B</span> be commensurable in length; I say that the square on <span class="ital">A</span> has to the square on <span class="ital">B</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number. 
      </p>
<p>For, since <span class="ital">A</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">B</span>, therefore <span class="ital">A</span> has to <span class="ital">B</span> the ratio which a number has to a number. [<a href="/elem.10.5">X. 5</a>] </p>
<p>Let it have to it the ratio which <span class="ital">C</span> has to <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>
<p>Since then, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>, while the ratio of the square on <span class="ital">A</span> to the square on <span class="ital">B</span> is duplicate of the ratio of <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>, for similar figures are in the duplicate ratio of their corresponding sides; [<a href="/elem.6.20.p.1">VI. 20, Por.</a>] and the ratio of the square on <span class="ital">C</span> to the square on <span class="ital">D</span> is duplicate of the ratio of <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>, for between two square numbers there is one mean proportional number, and the square number has to the square number the ratio duplicate of that which the side has to the side; [<a href="/elem.8.11">VIII. 11</a>] therefore also, as the square on <span class="ital">A</span> is to the square on <span class="ital">B</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">C</span> to the square on <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>
<p>Next, as the square on <span class="ital">A</span> is to the square on <span class="ital">B</span>, so let the square on <span class="ital">C</span> be to the square on <span class="ital">D</span>; I say that <span class="ital">A</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>
<p>For since, as the square on <span class="ital">A</span> is to the square on <span class="ital">B</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">C</span> to the square on <span class="ital">D</span>, while the ratio of the square on <span class="ital">A</span> to the square on <span class="ital">B</span> is duplicate of the ratio of <span class="ital">A</span> to <span class="ital">B</span>, and the ratio of the square on <span class="ital">C</span> to the square on <span class="ital">D</span> is duplicate of the ratio of <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>, therefore also, as <span class="ital">A</span> is to <span class="ital">B</span>, so is <span class="ital">C</span> to <span class="ital">D</span>. </p>
<p>Therefore <span class="ital">A</span> has to <span class="ital">B</span> the ratio which the number <span class="ital">C</span> has to the number <span class="ital">D</span>; therefore <span class="ital">A</span> is commensurable in length with <span class="ital">B</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.6">X. 6</a>] </p>
<p>Next, let <span class="ital">A</span> be incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">B</span>; I say that the square on <span class="ital">A</span> has not to the square on <span class="ital">B</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number. </p>
<p>For, if the square on <span class="ital">A</span> has to the square on <span class="ital">B</span> the ratio <pb n="30"/>which a square number has to a square number, <span class="ital">A</span> will be commensurable with <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>
<p>But it is not; therefore the square on <span class="ital">A</span> has not to the square on <span class="ital">B</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number. </p>
<p>Again, let the square on <span class="ital">A</span> not have to the square on <span class="ital">B</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; I say that <span class="ital">A</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>
<p>For, if <span class="ital">A</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">B</span>, the square on <span class="ital">A</span> will have to the square on <span class="ital">B</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number. </p>
<p>But it has not; therefore <span class="ital">A</span> is not commensurable in length with <span class="ital">B</span>. </p>
<p>Therefore etc. </p>
<div id="elem.10.9.p.1" class="porism">
       <h1>PORISM.</h1>
<p>And it is manifest from what has been proved that straight lines commensurable in length are always commensurable in square also, but those commensurable in square are not always commensurable in length also.</p>

   &lt;h1&gt;LEMMA.&lt;/h1&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>[It has been proved in the arithmetical books that similar plane numbers have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number, [<a href="/elem.8.26">VIII. 26</a>] and that, if two numbers have to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number, they are similar plane numbers. [Converse of <a href="/elem.8.26">VIII. 26</a>] </p>
<p>And it is manifest from these propositions that numbers which are not similar plane numbers, that is, those which have not their sides proportional, have not to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number. </p>
<p>For, if they have, they will be similar plane numbers: which is contrary to the hypothesis. </p>
<p>Therefore numbers which are not similar plane numbers have not to one another the ratio which a square number has to a square number.]</p>
