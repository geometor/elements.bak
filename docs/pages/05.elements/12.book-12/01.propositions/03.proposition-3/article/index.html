             <p><hi rend="ital">Any pyramid which has a triangular base is divided into two pyramids equal and similar to one another</hi>, <hi rend="ital">similar to the whole and having triangular bases</hi>, <hi rend="ital">and into two equal prisms; and the two prisms are greater than the half of the whole pyramid.</hi>
      </p>
<p>===</p>
<p><span class="ital">Any pyramid which has a triangular base is divded into two pyramids equal and similar to one another</span>, <span class="ital">similar to the whole and having triangular bases</span>, <span class="ital">and into two equal prisms; and the two prisms are greater than the half of the whole pyramid.</span>
      </p>
<p>Let there be a pyramid of which the triangle <span class="ital">ABC</span> is the base and the point <span class="ital">D</span> the vertex; I say that the pyramid <span class="ital">ABCD</span> is divded into two pyramids equal to one another, having triangular bases and similar to the whole pyramid, and into two equal prisms; and the two prisms are greater than the half of the whole pyramid. 
      </p>
<p>For let <span class="ital">AB</span>, <span class="ital">BC</span>, <span class="ital">CA</span>, <span class="ital">AD</span>, <span class="ital">DB</span>, <span class="ital">DC</span> be bisected at the points <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">K</span>, <span class="ital">L</span>, and let <span class="ital">HE</span>, <span class="ital">EG</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span>, <span class="ital">HK</span>, <span class="ital">KL</span>, <span class="ital">LH</span>, <span class="ital">KF</span>, <span class="ital">FG</span> be joined. </p>
<p>Since <span class="ital">AE</span> is equal to <span class="ital">EB</span>, and <span class="ital">AH</span> to <span class="ital">DH</span>, therefore <span class="ital">EH</span> is parallel to <span class="ital">DB</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.2">VI. 2</a>] <pb n="379"/></p>
<p>For the same reason <span class="ital">HK</span> is also parallel to <span class="ital">AB</span>. </p>
<p>Therefore <span class="ital">HEBK</span> is a parallelogram; therefore <span class="ital">HK</span> is equal to <span class="ital">EB</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.34">I. 34</a>] </p>
<p>But <span class="ital">EB</span> is equal to <span class="ital">EA</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AE</span> is also equal to <span class="ital">HK</span>. </p>
<p>But <span class="ital">AH</span> is also equal to <span class="ital">HD</span>; therefore the two sides <span class="ital">EA</span>, <span class="ital">AH</span> are equal to the two sides <span class="ital">KH</span>, <span class="ital">HD</span> respectively, and the angle <span class="ital">EAH</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">KHD</span>; therefore the base <span class="ital">EH</span> is equal to the base <span class="ital">KD</span>. [<a href="/elem.1.4">I. 4</a>] </p>
<p>Therefore the triangle <span class="ital">AEH</span> is equal and similar to the triangle <span class="ital">HKD</span>. </p>
<p>For the same reason the triangle <span class="ital">AHG</span> is also equal and similar to the triangle <span class="ital">HLD</span>. </p>
<p>Now, since two straight lines <span class="ital">EH</span>, <span class="ital">HG</span> meeting one another are parallel to two straight lines <span class="ital">KD</span>, <span class="ital">DL</span> meeting one another, and are not in the same plane, they will contain equal angles. [<a href="/elem.11.10">XI. 10</a>] </p>
<p>Therefore the angle <span class="ital">EHG</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">KDL</span>. </p>
<p>And, since the two straight lines <span class="ital">EH</span>, <span class="ital">HG</span> are equal to the two <span class="ital">KD</span>, <span class="ital">DL</span> respectively, and the angle <span class="ital">EHG</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">KDL</span>, therefore the base <span class="ital">EG</span> is equal to the base <span class="ital">KL</span>; [<a href="/elem.1.4">I. 4</a>] therefore the triangle <span class="ital">EHG</span> is equal and similar to the triangle <span class="ital">KDL</span>. </p>
<p>For the same reason the triangle <span class="ital">AEG</span> is also equal and similar to the triangle <span class="ital">HKL</span>. </p>
<p>Therefore the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="ital">AEG</span> is the base and the point <span class="ital">H</span> the vertex is equal and similar to the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="ital">HKL</span> is the base and the point <span class="ital">D</span> the vertex. [<a href="/elem.11.def.10">XI. Def. 10</a>] </p>
<p>And, since <span class="ital">HK</span> has been drawn parallel to <span class="ital">AB</span>, one of the sides of the triangle <span class="ital">ADB</span>, <pb n="380"/>the triangle <span class="ital">ADB</span> is equiangular to the triangle <span class="ital">DHK</span>, [<a href="/elem.1.29">I. 29</a>] and they have their sides proportional; therefore the triangle <span class="ital">ADB</span> is similar to the triangle <span class="ital">DHK</span>. [<a href="/elem.6.def.1">VI. Def. 1</a>] </p>
<p>For the same reason the triangle <span class="ital">DBC</span> is also similar to the triangle <span class="ital">DKL</span>, and the triangle <span class="ital">ADC</span> to the triangle <span class="ital">DLH</span>. </p>
<p>Now, since the two straight lines <span class="ital">BA</span>, <span class="ital">AC</span> meeting one another are parallel to the two straight lines <span class="ital">KH</span>, <span class="ital">HL</span> meeting one another, not in the same plane, they will contain equal angles. [<a href="/elem.11.10">XI. 10</a>] </p>
<p>Therefore the angle <span class="ital">BAC</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">KHL</span>. </p>
<p>And, as <span class="ital">BA</span> is to <span class="ital">AC</span>, so is <span class="ital">KH</span> to <span class="ital">HL</span>; therefore the triangle <span class="ital">ABC</span> is similar to the triangle <span class="ital">HKL</span>. </p>
<p>Therefore also the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="ital">ABC</span> is the base and the point <span class="ital">D</span> the vertex is similar to the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="ital">HKL</span> is the base and the point <span class="ital">D</span> the vertex. </p>
<p>But the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="ital">HKL</span> is the base and the point <span class="ital">D</span> the vertex was proved similar to the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="ital">AEG</span> is the base and the point <span class="ital">H</span> the vertex. </p>
<p>Therefore each of the pyramids <span class="ital">AEGH</span>, <span class="ital">HKLD</span> is similar to the whole pyramid <span class="ital">ABCD</span>. </p>
<p>Next, since <span class="ital">BF</span> is equal to <span class="ital">FC</span>, the parallelogram <span class="ital">EBFG</span> is double of the triangle <span class="ital">GFC</span>. </p>
<p>And since, if there be two prisms of equal height, and one have a parallelogram as base, and the other a triangle, and if the parallelogram be double of the triangle, the prisms are equal, [<a href="/elem.11.39">XI. 39</a>] therefore the prism contained by the two triangles <span class="ital">BKF</span>, <span class="ital">EHG</span>, and the three parallelograms <span class="ital">EBFG</span>, <span class="ital">EBKH</span>, <span class="ital">HKFG</span> is equal to the prism contained by the two triangles <span class="ital">GFC</span>, <span class="ital">HKL</span> and the three parallelograms <span class="ital">KFCL</span>, <span class="ital">LCGH</span>, <span class="ital">HKFG</span>. </p>
<p>And it is manifest that each of the prisms, namely that in which the parallelogram <span class="ital">EBFG</span> is the base and the straight line <span class="ital">HK</span> is its opposite, and that in which the triangle <span class="ital">GFC</span> is the base and the triangle <span class="ital">HKL</span> its opposite, is greater than each of the pyramids of which the triangles <span class="ital">AEG</span>, <span class="ital">HKL</span> are the bases and the points <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> the vertices, <pb n="381"/>inasmuch as, if we join the straight lines <span class="ital">EF</span>, <span class="ital">EK</span>, the prism in which the parallelogram <span class="ital">EBFG</span> is the base and the straight line <span class="ital">HK</span> its opposite is greater than the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="ital">EBF</span> is the base and the point <span class="ital">K</span> the vertex. </p>
<p>But the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="ital">EBF</span> is the base and the point <span class="ital">K</span> the vertex is equal to the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="ital">AEG</span> is the base and the point <span class="ital">H</span> the vertex; for they are contained by equal and similar planes. </p>
<p>Hence also the prism in which the parallelogram <span class="ital">EBFG</span> is the base and the straight line <span class="ital">HK</span> its opposite is greater than the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="ital">AEG</span> is the base and the point <span class="ital">H</span> the vertex. </p>
<p>But the prism in which the parallelogram <span class="ital">EBFG</span> is the base and the straight line <span class="ital">HK</span> its opposite is equal to the prism in which the triangle <span class="ital">GFC</span> is the base and the triangle <span class="ital">HKL</span> its opposite, and the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="ital">AEG</span> is the base and the point <span class="ital">H</span> the vertex is equal to the pyramid of which the triangle <span class="ital">HKL</span> is the base and the point <span class="ital">D</span> the vertex. </p>
<p>Therefore the said two prisms are greater than the said two pyramids of which the triangles <span class="ital">AEG</span>, <span class="ital">HKL</span> are the bases and the points <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">D</span> the vertices. </p>
<p>Therefore the whole pyramid, of which the triangle <span class="ital">ABC</span> is the base and the point <span class="ital">D</span> the vertex, has been divded into two pyramids equal to one another and into two equal prisms, and the two prisms are greater than the half of the whole pyramid.
