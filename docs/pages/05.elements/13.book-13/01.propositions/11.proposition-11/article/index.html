             <p><hi rend="ital">If in a circle which has its diameter rational an equilateral pentagon be inscribed</hi>, <hi rend="ital">the side of the pentagon is the irrational straight line called minor.</hi>
      </p>
<p>===</p>
<p><span class="ital">If in a circle which has its diameter rational an equilateral pentagon be inscribed</span>, <span class="ital">the side of the pentagon is the irrational straight line called minor.</span>
      </p>
<p>For in the circle <span class="ital">ABCDE</span> which has its diameter rational let the equilateral pentagon <span class="ital">ABCDE</span> be inscribed; I say that the side of the pentagon is the irrational straight line called minor. </p>
<p>For let the centre of the circle, the point <span class="ital">F</span>, be taken, let <span class="ital">AF</span>, <span class="ital">FB</span> be joined and carried through to the points, <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">H</span>, let <span class="ital">AC</span> be joined, and let <span class="ital">FK</span> be made a fourth part of <span class="ital">AF</span>. </p>
<p>Now <span class="ital">AF</span> is rational; therefore <span class="ital">FK</span> is also rational. </p>
<p>But <span class="ital">BF</span> is also rational; therefore the whole <span class="ital">BK</span> is rational. </p>
<p>And, since the circumference <span class="ital">ACG</span> is equal to the circumference <span class="ital">ADG</span>, and in them <span class="ital">ABC</span> is equal to <span class="ital">AED</span>, therefore the remainder <span class="ital">CG</span> is equal to the remainder <span class="ital">GD</span>. <pb n="462"/></p>
<p>And, if we join <span class="ital">AD</span>, we conclude that the angles at <span class="ital">L</span> are right, and <span class="ital">CD</span> is double of <span class="ital">CL</span>. </p>
<p>For the same reason the angles at <span class="ital">M</span> are also right, and <span class="ital">AC</span> is double of <span class="ital">CM</span>. 
      </p>
<p>Since then the angle <span class="ital">ALC</span> is equal to the angle <span class="ital">AMF</span>, and the angle <span class="ital">LAC</span> is common to the two triangles <span class="ital">ACL</span> and <span class="ital">AMF</span>, therefore the remaining angle <span class="ital">ACL</span> is equal to the remaining angle <span class="ital">MFA</span>; [<a href="/elem.1.32">I. 32</a>] therefore the triangle <span class="ital">ACL</span> is equiangular with the triangle <span class="ital">AMF</span>; therefore, proportionally, as <span class="ital">LC</span> is to <span class="ital">CA</span>, so is <span class="ital">MF</span> to <span class="ital">FA</span>. </p>
<p>And the doubles of the antecedents may be taken; therefore, as the double of <span class="ital">LC</span> is to <span class="ital">CA</span>, so is the double of <span class="ital">MF</span> to <span class="ital">FA</span>. </p>
<p>But, as the double of <span class="ital">MF</span> is to <span class="ital">FA</span>, so is <span class="ital">MF</span> to the half of <span class="ital">FA</span>; therefore also, as the double of <span class="ital">LC</span> is to <span class="ital">CA</span>, so is <span class="ital">MF</span> to the half of <span class="ital">FA</span>. </p>
<p>And the halves of the consequents may be taken; therefore, as the double of <span class="ital">LC</span> is to the half of <span class="ital">CA</span>, so is <span class="ital">MF</span> to the fourth of <span class="ital">FA</span>. <pb n="463"/></p>
<p>And <span class="ital">DC</span> is double of <span class="ital">LC</span>, <span class="ital">CM</span> is half of <span class="ital">CA</span>, and <span class="ital">FK</span> a fourth part of <span class="ital">FA</span>; therefore, as <span class="ital">DC</span> is to <span class="ital">CM</span>, so is <span class="ital">MF</span> to <span class="ital">FK</span>. </p>
<p><foreign lang="la">Componendo</foreign> also, as the sum of <span class="ital">DC</span>, <span class="ital">CM</span> is to <span class="ital">CM</span>, so is <span class="ital">MK</span> to <span class="ital">KF</span>; [<a href="/elem.5.18">V. 18</a>] therefore also, as the square on the sum of <span class="ital">DC</span>, <span class="ital">CM</span> is to the square on <span class="ital">CM</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">MK</span> to the square on <span class="ital">KF</span>. </p>
<p>And since, when the straight line subtending two sides of the pentagon, as <span class="ital">AC</span>, is cut in extreme and mean ratio, the greater segment is equal to the side of the pentagon, that is, to <span class="ital">DC</span>, [<a href="/elem.13.8">XIII. 8</a>] while the square on the greater segment added to the half of the whole is five times the square on the half of the whole, [<a href="/elem.13.1">XIII. 1</a>] and <span class="ital">CM</span> is half of the whole <span class="ital">AC</span>, therefore the square on <span class="ital">DC</span>, <span class="ital">CM</span> taken as one straight line is five times the square on <span class="ital">CM</span>. </p>
<p>But it was proved that, as the square on <span class="ital">DC</span>, <span class="ital">CM</span> taken as one straight line is to the square on <span class="ital">CM</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">MK</span> to the square on <span class="ital">KF</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">MK</span> is five times the square on <span class="ital">KF</span>. </p>
<p>But the square on <span class="ital">KF</span> is rational, for the diameter is rational; therefore the square on <span class="ital">MK</span> is also rational; therefore <span class="ital">MK</span> is rational </p>
<p>And, since <span class="ital">BF</span> is quadruple of <span class="ital">FK</span>, therefore <span class="ital">BK</span> is five times <span class="ital">KF</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">BK</span> is twenty-five times the square on <span class="ital">KF</span>. </p>
<p>But the square on <span class="ital">MK</span> is five times the square on <span class="ital">KF</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">BK</span> is five times the square on <span class="ital">KM</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">BK</span> has not to the square on <span class="ital">KM</span> the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore <span class="ital">BK</span> is incommensurable in length with <span class="ital">KM</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.9">X. 9</a>] </p>
<p>And each of them is rational. </p>
<p>Therefore <span class="ital">BK</span>, <span class="ital">KM</span> are rational straight lines commensurable in square only. <pb n="464"/></p>
<p>But, if from a rational straight line there be subtracted a rational straight line which is commensurable with the whole in square only, the remainder is irrational, namely an apotome; therefore <span class="ital">MB</span> is an apotome and <span class="ital">MK</span> the annex to it. [<a href="/elem.10.73">X. 73</a>] </p>
<p>I say next that <span class="ital">MB</span> is also a fourth apotome. </p>
<p>Let the square on <span class="ital">N</span> be equal to that by which the square on <span class="ital">BK</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">KM</span>; therefore the square on <span class="ital">BK</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">KM</span> by the square on <span class="ital">N</span>. </p>
<p>And, since <span class="ital">KF</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">FB</span>, <foreign lang="la">componendo</foreign> also, <span class="ital">KB</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">FB</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.15">X. 15</a>] </p>
<p>But <span class="ital">BF</span> is commensurable with <span class="ital">BH</span>; therefore <span class="ital">BK</span> is also commensurable with <span class="ital">BH</span>. [<a href="/elem.10.12">X. 12</a>] </p>
<p>And, since the square on <span class="ital">BK</span> is five times the square on <span class="ital">KM</span>, therefore the square on <span class="ital">BK</span> has to the square on <span class="ital">KM</span> the ratio which 5 has to 1. </p>
<p>Therefore, <foreign lang="la">convertendo</foreign>, the square on <span class="ital">BK</span> has to the square on <span class="ital">N</span> the ratio which 5 has to 4 [<a href="/elem.5.19.p.1">V. 19, Por.</a>], and this is not the ratio which a square number has to a square number; therefore <span class="ital">BK</span> is incommensurable with <span class="ital">N</span>; [<a href="/elem.10.9">X. 9</a>] therefore the square on <span class="ital">BK</span> is greater than the square on <span class="ital">KM</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="ital">BK</span>. </p>
<p>Since then the square on the whole <span class="ital">BK</span> is greater than the square on the annex <span class="ital">KM</span> by the square on a straight line incommensurable with <span class="ital">BK</span>, and the whole <span class="ital">BK</span> is commensurable with the rational straight line, <span class="ital">BH</span>, set out, therefore <span class="ital">MB</span> is a fourth apotome. [<a href="/elem.10.def.3.4">X. Deff. III. 4</a>] </p>
<p>But the rectangle contained by a rational straight line and a fourth apotome is irrational, and its square root is irrational, and is called minor. [<a href="/elem.10.94">X. 94</a>] </p>
<p>But the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is equal to the rectangle <span class="ital">HB</span>, <span class="ital">BM</span>, because, when <span class="ital">AH</span> is joined, the triangle <span class="ital">ABH</span> is equiangular with the triangle <span class="ital">ABM</span>, and, as <span class="ital">HB</span> is to <span class="ital">BA</span>, so is <span class="ital">AB</span> to <span class="ital">BM</span>. <pb n="465"/></p>
<p>Therefore the side <span class="ital">AB</span> of the pentagon is the irrational straight line called minor. Q. E. D.</p>
