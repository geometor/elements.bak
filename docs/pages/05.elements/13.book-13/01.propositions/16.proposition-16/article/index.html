<p><span class="ital">To construct an icosahedron and comprehend it in a sphere</span>, <span class="ital">like the aforesaid figures; and to prove that the side of the icosahedron is the irrational straight line called minor.</span>
      </p>
<p>Let the diameter <span class="ital">AB</span> of the given sphere be set out, and let it be cut at <span class="ital">C</span> so that <span class="ital">AC</span> is quadruple of <span class="ital">CB</span>, let the semicircle <span class="ital">ADB</span> be described on <span class="ital">AB</span>, let the straight line <span class="ital">CD</span> be drawn from <span class="ital">C</span> at right angles to <span class="ital">AB</span>, and let <span class="ital">DB</span> be joined;  let the circle <span class="ital">EFGHK</span> be set out and let its radius be equal to <span class="ital">DB</span>, let the equilateral and equiangular pentagon <span class="ital">EFGHK</span> be inscribed in the circle <span class="ital">EFGHK</span>, let the circumferences <span class="ital">EF</span>, <span class="ital">FG</span>, <span class="ital">GH</span>, <span class="ital">HK</span>, <span class="ital">KE</span> be bisected at the points <span class="ital">L</span>, <span class="ital">M</span>, <span class="ital">N</span>, <span class="ital">O</span>, <span class="ital">P</span>, and let <span class="ital">LM</span>, <span class="ital">MN</span>, <span class="ital">NO</span>, <span class="ital">OP</span>, <span class="ital">PL</span>, <span class="ital">EP</span> be joined. <pb n="482"/></p>
<p>Therefore the pentagon <span class="ital">LMNOP</span> is also equilateral, and the straight line <span class="ital">EP</span> belongs to a decagon. </p>
<p>Now from the points <span class="ital">E</span>, <span class="ital">F</span>, <span class="ital">G</span>, <span class="ital">H</span>, <span class="ital">K</span> let the straight lines <span class="ital">EQ</span>, <span class="ital">FR</span>, <span class="ital">GS</span>, <span class="ital">HT</span>, <span class="ital">KU</span> be set up at right angles to the plane of the circle, and let them be equal to the radius of the circle <span class="ital">EFGHK</span>, let <span class="ital">QR</span>, <span class="ital">RS</span>, <span class="ital">ST</span>, <span class="ital">TU</span>, <span class="ital">UQ</span>, <span class="ital">QL</span>, <span class="ital">LR</span>, <span class="ital">RM</span>, <span class="ital">MS</span>, <span class="ital">SN</span>, <span class="ital">NT</span>, <span class="ital">TO</span>, <span class="ital">OU</span>, <span class="ital">UP</span>, <span class="ital">PQ</span> be joined. </p>
<p>Now, since each of the straight lines <span class="ital">EQ</span>, <span class="ital">KU</span> is at right angles to the same plane, therefore <span class="ital">EQ</span> is parallel to <span class="ital">KU</span>. [<a href="/elem.11.6">XI. 6</a>] </p>
<p>But it is also equal to it; and the straight lines joining those extremities of equal and parallel straight lines which are in the same direction are equal and parallel. [<a href="/elem.1.33">I. 33</a>] </p>
<p>Therefore <span class="ital">QU</span> is equal and parallel to <span class="ital">EK</span>. </p>
<p>But <span class="ital">EK</span> belongs to an equilateral pentagon; therefore <span class="ital">QU</span> also belongs to the equilateral pentagon inscribed in the circle <span class="ital">EFGHK</span>. </p>
<p>For the same reason each of the straight lines <span class="ital">QR</span>, <span class="ital">RS</span>, <span class="ital">ST</span>, <span class="ital">TU</span> also belongs to the equilateral pentagon inscribed in the circle <span class="ital">EFGHK</span>; therefore the pentagon <span class="ital">QRSTU</span> is equilateral. </p>
<p>And, since <span class="ital">QE</span> belongs to a hexagon, and <span class="ital">EP</span> to a decagon, and the angle <span class="ital">QEP</span> is right, therefore <span class="ital">QP</span> belongs to a pentagon; for the square on the side of the pentagon is equal to the square on the side of the hexagon and the square on the side of the decagon inscribed in the same circle. [<a href="/elem.13.10">XIII. 10</a>] </p>
<p>For the same reason <span class="ital">PU</span> is also a side of a pentagon. </p>
<p>But <span class="ital">QU</span> also belongs to a pentagon; therefore the triangle <span class="ital">QPU</span> is equilateral. </p>
<p>For the same reason each of the triangles <span class="ital">QLR</span>, <span class="ital">RMS</span>, <span class="ital">SNT</span>, <span class="ital">TOU</span> is also equilateral. <pb n="483"/></p>
<p>And, since each of the straight lines <span class="ital">QL</span>, <span class="ital">QP</span> was proved to belong to a pentagon, and <span class="ital">LP</span> also belongs to a pentagon, therefore the triangle <span class="ital">QLP</span> is equilateral. </p>
<p>For the same reason each of the triangles <span class="ital">LRM</span>, <span class="ital">MSN</span>, <span class="ital">NTO</span>, <span class="ital">OUP</span> is also equilateral. </p>
<p>Let the centre of the circle <span class="ital">EFGHK</span> the point <span class="ital">V</span>, be taken; from <span class="ital">V</span> let <span class="ital">VZ</span> be set up at right angles to the plane of the circle, let it be produced in the other direction, as <span class="ital">VX</span>, let there be cut off <span class="ital">VW</span>, the side of a hexagon, and each of the straight lines <span class="ital">VX</span>, <span class="ital">WZ</span>, being sides of a decagon, and let <span class="ital">QZ</span>, <span class="ital">QW</span>, <span class="ital">UZ</span>, <span class="ital">EV</span>, <span class="ital">LV</span>, <span class="ital">LX</span>, <span class="ital">XM</span> be joined. </p>
<p>Now, since each of the straight lines <span class="ital">VW</span>, <span class="ital">QE</span> is at right angles to the plane of the circle, therefore <span class="ital">VW</span> is parallel to <span class="ital">QE</span>. [<a href="/elem.11.6">XI. 6</a>] </p>
<p>But they are also equal; therefore <span class="ital">EV</span>, <span class="ital">QW</span> are also equal and parallel. [<a href="/elem.1.33">I. 33</a>] </p>
<p>But <span class="ital">EV</span> belongs to a hexagon; therefore <span class="ital">QW</span> also belongs to a hexagon. </p>
<p>And, since <span class="ital">QW</span> belongs to a hexagon, and <span class="ital">WZ</span> to a decagon, and the angle <span class="ital">QWZ</span> is right, therefore <span class="ital">QZ</span> belongs to a pentagon. [<a href="/elem.13.10">XIII. 10</a>] </p>
<p>For the same reason <span class="ital">UZ</span> also belongs to a pentagon, inasmuch as, if we join <span class="ital">VK</span>, <span class="ital">WU</span>, they will be equal and opposite, and <span class="ital">VK</span>, being a radius, belongs to a hexagon; [<a href="/elem.4.15.p.1">IV. 15, Por.</a>] therefore <span class="ital">WU</span> also belongs to a hexagon. </p>
<p>But <span class="ital">WZ</span> belongs to a decagon, and the angle <span class="ital">UWZ</span> is right; therefore <span class="ital">UZ</span> belongs to a pentagon. [<a href="/elem.13.10">XIII. 10</a>] </p>
<p>But <span class="ital">QU</span> also belongs to a pentagon; therefore the triangle <span class="ital">QUZ</span> is equilateral. <pb n="484"/></p>
<p>For the same reason each of the remaining triangles of which the straight lines <span class="ital">QR</span>, <span class="ital">RS</span>, <span class="ital">ST</span>, <span class="ital">TU</span> are the bases, and the point <span class="ital">Z</span> the vertex, is also equilateral. </p>
<p>Again, since <span class="ital">VL</span> belongs to a hexagon, and <span class="ital">VX</span> to a decagon, and the angle <span class="ital">LVX</span> is right, therefore <span class="ital">LX</span> belongs to a pentagon. [<a href="/elem.13.10">XIII. 10</a>] </p>
<p>For the same reason, if we join <span class="ital">MV</span>, which belongs to a hexagon, <span class="ital">MX</span> is also inferred to belong to a pentagon. </p>
<p>But <span class="ital">LM</span> also belongs to a pentagon; therefore the triangle <span class="ital">LMX</span> is equilateral. </p>
<p>Similarly it can be proved that each of the remaining triangles of which <span class="ital">MN</span>, <span class="ital">NO</span>, <span class="ital">OP</span>, <span class="ital">PL</span> are the bases, and the point <span class="ital">X</span> the vertex, is also equilateral. </p>
<p>Therefore an icosahedron has been constructed which is contained by twenty equilateral triangles. </p>
<p>It is next required to comprehend it in the given sphere, and to prove that the side of the icosahedron is the irrational straight line called minor. </p>
<p>For, since <span class="ital">VW</span> belongs to a hexagon, and <span class="ital">WZ</span> to a decagon, therefore <span class="ital">VZ</span> has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at <span class="ital">W</span>, and <span class="ital">VW</span> is its greater segment; [<a href="/elem.13.9">XIII. 9</a>] therefore, as <span class="ital">ZV</span> is to <span class="ital">VW</span>, so is <span class="ital">VW</span> to <span class="ital">WZ</span>. </p>
<p>But <span class="ital">VW</span> is equal to <span class="ital">VE</span>, and <span class="ital">WZ</span> to <span class="ital">VX</span>; therefore, as <span class="ital">ZV</span> is to <span class="ital">VE</span>, so is <span class="ital">EV</span> to <span class="ital">VX</span>. </p>
<p>And the angles <span class="ital">ZVE</span>, <span class="ital">EVX</span> are right; therefore, if we join the straight line <span class="ital">EZ</span>, the angle <span class="ital">XEZ</span> will be right because of the similarity of the triangles <span class="ital">XEZ</span>, <span class="ital">VEZ</span>. </p>
<p>For the same reason, since, as <span class="ital">ZV</span> is to <span class="ital">VW</span>, so is <span class="ital">VW</span> to <span class="ital">WZ</span>, and <span class="ital">ZV</span> is equal to <span class="ital">XW</span>, and <span class="ital">VW</span> to <span class="ital">WQ</span>, therefore, as <span class="ital">XW</span> is to <span class="ital">WQ</span>, so is <span class="ital">QW</span> to <span class="ital">WZ</span>. <pb n="485"/></p>
<p>And for this reason again, if we join <span class="ital">QX</span>, the angle at <span class="ital">Q</span> will be right; [<a href="/elem.6.8">VI. 8</a>] therefore the semicircle described on <span class="ital">XZ</span> will also pass through <span class="ital">Q</span>. [<a href="/elem.3.31">III. 31</a>] </p>
<p>And if, <span class="ital">XZ</span> remaining fixed, the semicircle be carried round and restored to the same position from which it began to be moved, it will also pass through <span class="ital">Q</span> and the remaining angular points of the icosahedron, and the icosahedron will have been comprehended in a sphere. </p>
<p>I say next that it is also comprehended in the given sphere. </p>
<p>For let <span class="ital">VW</span> be bisected at <span class="ital">A'</span>. </p>
<p>Then, since the straight line <span class="ital">VZ</span> has been cut in extreme and mean ratio at <span class="ital">W</span>, and <span class="ital">ZW</span> is its lesser segment, therefore the square on <span class="ital">ZW</span> added to the half of the greater segment, that is <span class="ital">WA'</span>, is five times the square on the half of the greater segment; [<a href="/elem.13.3">XIII. 3</a>] therefore the square on <span class="ital">ZA'</span> is five times the square on . </p>
<p>And <span class="ital">ZX</span> is double of <span class="ital">ZA'</span>, and <span class="ital">VW</span> double of ; therefore the square on <span class="ital">ZX</span> is five times the square on <span class="ital">WV</span>. </p>
<p>And, since <span class="ital">AC</span> is quadruple of <span class="ital">CB</span>, therefore <span class="ital">AB</span> is five times <span class="ital">BC</span>. </p>
<p>But, as <span class="ital">AB</span> is to <span class="ital">BC</span>, so is the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> to the square on <span class="ital">BD</span>; [<a href="/elem.6.8">VI. 8</a>, <a href="/elem.5.def.9">V. Def. 9</a>] therefore the square on <span class="ital">AB</span> is five times the square on <span class="ital">BD</span>. </p>
<p>But the square on <span class="ital">ZX</span> was also proved to be five times the square on <span class="ital">VW</span>. </p>
<p>And <span class="ital">DB</span> is equal to <span class="ital">VW</span>, for each of them is equal to the radius of the circle <span class="ital">EFGHK</span>; therefore <span class="ital">AB</span> is also equal to <span class="ital">XZ</span>. </p>
<p>And <span class="ital">AB</span> is the diameter of the given sphere; therefore <span class="ital">XZ</span> is also equal to the diameter of the given sphere. </p>
<p>Therefore the icosahedron has been comprehended in the given sphere <pb n="486"/></p>
<p>I say next that the side of the icosahedron is the irrational straight line called minor. </p>
<p>For, since the diameter of the sphere is rational, and the square on it is five times the square on the radius of the circle <span class="ital">EFGHK</span>, therefore the radius of the circle <span class="ital">EFGHK</span> is also rational; hence its diameter is also rational. </p>
<p>But, if an equilateral pentagon be inscribed in a circle which has its diameter rational, the side of the pentagon is the irrational straight line called minor. [<a href="/elem.13.11">XIII. 11</a>] </p>
<p>And the side of the pentagon <span class="ital">EFGHK</span> is the side of the icosahedron. </p>
<p>Therefore the side of the icosahedron is the irrational straight line called minor. </p>
<div id="elem.13.16.p.1" class="porism">
       <h1>PORISM.</h1>
<p>From this it is manifest that the square on the diameter of the sphere is five times the square on the radius of the circle from which the icosahedron has been described, and that the diameter of the sphere is composed of the side of the hexagon and two of the sides of the decagon inscribed in the same circle.
