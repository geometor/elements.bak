  On a given finite straight line to construct an equilateral triangle.

  -- Euclid

From the :ref:`given points` :math:`A` and :math:`B` construct :ref:`segment`
:math:`\overline{AB}`.

**PROBLEM:** construct an :ref:`equilateral triangle` on the :ref:`segment` 
:math:`\overline{AB}`. 

:ref:`Construct circle <construct a circle>` :math:`(A, B)` as :math:`c_1`

:ref:`Construct circle <construct a circle>` :math:`(B, A)` as :math:`c_2`

.. todo:: define intersection point

Identify the two intersection points of circles :math:`c_1` and :math:`c_2`
as points :math:`C` and :math:`D`

From the points :math:`A` and :math:`C` construct :ref:`segment`
:math:`\overline{AC}`.

From the points :math:`B` and :math:`C` construct :ref:`segment`
:math:`\overline{BC}`.


As the :ref:`circle` is defined, all points on the perimeter are an equal distance from the center.

| Now, since the point :math:`A` is the center of the circle :math:`c_1`
| And point :math:`B` and :math:`C` are on the perimeter of circle :math:`c_1`

:math:`\therefore` segment :math:`\overline{AC}` is equal to :math:`\overline{AB}`


| And point :math:`A` and :math:`C` are on the perimeter of circle :math:`c_2`

:math:`\therefore` segment :math:`\overline{BC}` is equal to :math:`\overline{AB}`

But **CA** was also proved equal to **AB**; therefore each of the straight lines
**CA**, **CB** is equal to **AB**.

.. And things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another;
.. :ref:`01.cn.01`

| As stated:
| :ref:`equals are equal`

:math:`\therefore` :math:`\overline{AC}` is also equal to :math:`\overline{BC}`

:math:`\therefore` the three segments :math:`\overline{AB}`, :math:`\overline{BC}`, :math:`\overline{AC}` are equal to one
another. 

:math:`\therefore` the triangle :math:`\triangle{ABC}` is equilateral; and it has been constructed on the
segment :math:`\overline{AB}`.
